        <p><em>Black lives matter.</em></p>
        <p>A week ago, I attended a protest in support of the BLM movement that had a neat idea; to distinguish between peaceful protestors and bad-faith agitators, everyone wore a white shirt with names written on them; citizens whose lives have been stolen due to police brutality and rampant civil racism. If someone was causing trouble without a white shirt, they&#39;d be easily identifiable. It was a silent march, and everyone walked in a single-file line across downtown Kansas City to hold vigil for George Floyd and the many others we have lost to the senseless evil of our criminal justice system, mirroring the &quot;Silent Parade&quot; held by the NAACP in 1917 New York City.</p>
        <p>These are the names I wrote:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Emmett Till (1955, Mississippi)</p>
        <p>At the age of 14 years old, Emmett Till flirted with a white girl named Carolyn Bryant. At 3am on August 28, 1955, two white men marched him out of his house into their truck and tied him up, despite his great aunt offering them money to leave. They drove him out to a barn, pistol whipped him until he was unconscious, shot him in the head, weighed him with a 70 pound fan, and dumped him in the river. His body was recovered three days later, marred beyond recognition; only identifiable by a silver ring he wore with the initials &quot;L.T.&quot;</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>Tamir Rice (2014, Cleveland)</p>
        <p>Tamir Rice was a 12-year-old boy playing with an airsoft gun at Cudell park. On November 22, 2014, two police officers drove up and shot him dead on sight. Video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw0EMLM1XRI">here</a>.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>John Africa (1985, Philadelphia)</p>
        <p>John Africa (born Vincent Leapheart) founded a back-to-nature movement called MOVE in 1972 West Philadelphia. A former army conscript during the Korean War, he developed a community ideology emphasizing religion, justice, individuality, and animal rights, among other things. As the movement grew, several neighbors issued various complaints, including a claim that MOVE organized armed patrols of their neighborhood, which preceded several conflicts with the police. After a shootout in 1978, when one police officer was killed, nine members were arrested for third degree murder. MOVE relocated to a new headquarters. In 1985, during another standoff with the police, Philadelphia mayor Frank Rizzo authorized the dropping of a firebomb (Tovex, a water-gel explosive), igniting a fire which eventually destroyed a rough total of sixty-five houses in the neighboring city block. This extraordinary story is documented in the 2013 film <a href="https://zeitgeistfilms.com/film/letthefireburn"><em>Let the Fire Burn</em></a>.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>Mahatma Gandhi (1948, New Delhi)</p>
        <p>Mahatma Gandhi organized the largest successful non-violent revolution against colonial British rule. He was killed on January 30 of 1948 by a Hindu nationalist. I don&#39;t need to belabor the story here. [Note: Gandhi was Hindu and a citizen of India]</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>James Powell (1964, Manhattan)</p>
        <p>An altercation developed between a local superintendent and three black boys. James Powell, age 15, arrived later, and allegedly pursued the superintendent into a building. After leaving almost immediately, he was shot three times by off-duty officer Lieutenant Gilligan, after raising his arms up in defense. Gilligan later claimed the boy was in possession of a knife. This incident sparked six consecutive nights of riots and protests in Harlem and surrounding neighborhoods, leading to vandalism and several protestors being beaten by NYPD officers. 118 protesters were injured, and one died.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>Botham Jean (2018, Dallas)</p>
        <p>An off-duty police officer came home, entered the wrong apartment, saw a black man, and killed him, believing he was a burglar. Initially charged with manslaughter, protests ensued, and she was later charged with murder. On the day of Jean&#39;s funeral, Dallas police released a search warrant showing that he had possessed 10.4 grams of marijuana.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>John Smith (1967, Newark)</p>
        <p>On the evening of July 12, 1967, a taxi driver was pulled over by the police for &quot;following another vehicle too closely&quot;. An altercation followed, and Smith was beaten badly, arrested, and dragged to the nearest precinct. Rumors spread that Smith had died in police custody, and a citywide riot broke out that lasted five days. At the end, 26 people had died and hundreds more were injured. You can read the police report <a href="http://riseupnewark.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/NPD-Chronological-Summary-of-Newark-Riots-Excerpt-on-John-Smith-ilovepdf-compressed.pdf">here</a>; I couldn&#39;t find any published eyewitness accounts.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>Eric Garner (2014, Staten Island)</p>
        <p>Eric Garner was selling loose cigarettes outside a store when he was approached by a plainclothes police officer. After pleading with the officer to leave him alone, he was placed under arrest; when he pulled his arms away from the handcuffs, saying &quot;don&#39;t touch me, please&quot;, the officer placed him in a chokehold, and within minutes he had died of suffocation. He was recorded saying &quot;I can&#39;t breathe&quot; eleven times before he went silent. The officer who killed him was not indicted, but was eventually fired -- five years after the incident. Video <a href="https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x30s2lp">here</a>.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>Daniel Shaver (2016, Arizona)</p>
        <p>Daniel Shaver was shot in the hallway of his own home after brandishing a pellet gun in his window. He had been having drinks with his friends when a rookie police officer showed up to investigate. As the officer attempted to apprehend Shaver in the hallway, he shouted a series of bizarre and confusing commands to have Shaver crawl forward to be arrested. Shaver attempted to comply, but instinctively reached behind himself, likely to either pull up his pants or scratch his lower back. The officer opened fire, striking Shaver five times and killing him almost instantly. The officer was fired and charged with second degree murder, but was acquitted. The officer was later reinstated into the force, but retired after only a month due to post-traumatic stress disorder from the incident. Video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYRRSdjdcbo">here</a>. [Note: Daniel Shaver was white]</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>Robert Hall (1943, Georgia)</p>
        <p>A landmark Supreme Court decision, <em>Screws v. United States</em>,was handed down on May 7, 1945, regarding a brutal police killing of an unarmed black man named Robert Hall, two years earlier. A review published by Robert K Carr describes the incident as follows:</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px;"><em>Claud Screws was the sheriff of Baker County, reputedly one of the most backward counties in the state of Georgia. Aided by the defendant Jones, a policeman in the town of Newton in Baker County, and the defendant Kelley, a deputy sheriff, he arrested Robert Hall, a negro citizen of the United States, late on the night of January 29, 1943, on a warrant charging theft of a tire. Hall was handcuffed and taken by car to the court house. There, as he left the car, he was beaten by the three men with their fists and a two-pound blackjack. The defendants claimed that Hall used insulting language and, although he was still handcuffed, that he reached for a gun. Thereafter he was knocked to the ground and beaten for from fifteen to thirty minutes until he was unconscious. Hall was then dragged feet first through the court house yard into the jail and thrown upon the floor dying. An ambulance was called&quot; and he was taken to a hospital where he died within an hour without regaining consciousness. There was evidence that Screws and Hall had had a previous altercation over the possession of a gun by Hall, as the result of which Screws nursed a grudge against Hall and had threatened to &quot;get&quot; him.</em></p>
        <p> It took the court nearly seven months to render a decision, which ultimately reduced the federal government&#39;s authority to prosecute state and local officials for violating the due process clause of the 14th amendment. According to legal historian Christopher Waldrep, this case severely limited federal civil rights prosecutions for years. Carr&#39;s review is a fascinating look into the case and surrounding legal precedent; you can read it <a href="https://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi">here</a>.</p>
        </li>
        </ul>
        <p>==</p>
        <p> Two other observations stuck with me from the protest. As the march concluded, the group kneeled in silence for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, while an organizer read off a long list of names of black men and women who had been killed unjustly. About halfway through, a (black) man, not participating in the protest, began playing music loudly. There was some discomfort, but the reading carried on, until the man started shouting at the crowd: &quot;Fuck you! Fuck you all! You&#39;re all white!&quot;, among other things. Discomfort intensified, and people began nervously looking around, not sure what to do. Two local security officers (I don&#39;t think they were police) approached him and asked him to calm down, which only increased his shouting. Eventually, organizers from the protest came over, talked him down, and the man left.</p>
        <p> The only other thing I noticed, in a crowd of white shirts and solemn faces, was a young man wearing bright orange construction gear and a Guy Fawkes mask. No idea what that was about.</p>

      <br />

      <p><strong>Sun Jun 7</strong></p>
      <p>As far as I can tell, there are three major reasons to write.</p>
      <ol>
      <li>To help people</li>
      <li>To get things you want without having to do patient hard work</li>
      <li>Because you&#39;re a lonely egotistical maniac who just can&#39;t shut up</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Let&#39;s go in order I guess. Writing actually doesn&#39;t help people that much. The primary benefits of good writing seem to be 1) distracting or entertaining people for a while, or 2) priming their subconscious with &quot;good&quot; ideas that have a small chance of floating into their mind later to influence them in a positive way.</p>
      <p>Of these, the entertainment value seems like the clearest net positive. There&#39;s nothing wrong with good entertainment, besides being distracting if the reader is trying to procrastinate on something important. With all this cognitive surplus we have in the modern age, and distressingly few outlets to channel it into something productive, I have to say that I&#39;m pro entertainment. We honestly don&#39;t have enough good entertainment, which leads people to derive &quot;entertainment&quot; from things which actually should be important and thoughtful (like politics).</p>
      <p>Benefit 2 is extremely tricky. In general, there are a great many positives from having and sharing good ideas. But actually executing this on purpose is basically impossible for humans. For starters, your ideas might not actually be good; they could be bad ideas. Even if you&#39;re expressing good things, they could come at the wrong time. Your intentions could be noble, but the reader might be pissed off at some subtle political connotation in your writing, so they associate your &quot;good&quot; thought as being a &quot;bad&quot; thought; propaganda from the enemy team (this happened for me with a lot of Social Justice content in my early 20s).</p>
      <p>Most of all, it&#39;s just not your place. Writing can have an incredibly strong influence on people, especially young minds. Writing necessarily violates the first principle of the Hippocratic oath; that of doing no harm. There is no surgical way to influence people positively through writing. (Silly example from my life; I was obsessed with Paul Graham in college, while I was studying computer science. Paul Graham is great. But he influenced me so much that I got pissed off with everyone around me, dropped out of college, and moved to San Francisco, where I spent a lot of time in misery and never even came close to founding a startup. Smh.)</p>
      <p>In short, writing can be <em>good</em>, but it cannot be <em>perfect</em>. &quot;Every good and perfect gift comes from above, from the Father of lights, in whom is no change nor shadow of turning&quot; - James 1:17.</p>
      <p>There is a third type of benefit people seem to get from writing, which is the whole genre of books and media that try to tell you directly what to think and how to behave. I never got much value from this stuff and I don&#39;t really understand it, but it seems to be popular -- in my estimation about 95% of books and essays seem to have a kind of &quot;do as I say and then things will be good for you&quot; flavor to it; 7 Habits Of Highly Effective Teens, 12 Rules For Life, etc. C&#39;est la vie; if people enjoy it, good for them. I personally choose to avoid this stuff where possible.</p>
      <p>===</p>
      <p>Why else do people write? To get things they want without having to do hard work.</p>
      <p>A lot of romantics learn to play guitar or write poetry to help them get laid. Businesspeople publish books on business so they can demonstrate to other business business-ers how business-y they are about business. Politicians and activists publish manifestos so they get votes and support. (You can actually tell a lot about what a person/party stands for just by reading them; I liked Andrew Yang when he was on the Joe Rogan podcast, but it wasn&#39;t until I read The War on Normal People that I was like &quot;holy crap this guy is serious&quot;).</p>
      <p>Art in general works because it is a display of talent, of understanding, of having a grasp on things, and (usually) a signal of the discipline and free energy it requires to learn, practice, and hone a challenging skill. Finally, it demonstrates the commitment to publish a beautiful, polished artifact.</p>
      <p>Writing is different from other artistic skills because, while it does require talent, it doesn&#39;t actually require too much discipline to churn out something that resonates with people strongly. It does require a lot of reading and writing, but it still doesn&#39;t need the sort of rote boring practice as, say, learning to play piano, or painting on canvas. You can just read a lot willy-nilly and poop out dumb thoughts to a journal over a couple of years and become decent enough at it to get a bunch of likes on the social medias.</p>
      <p>It kind of feels like a cheat code, to be honest. Good writing hijacks your attention and draws you in in ways that are, frankly, a bit rude. Humans are just highly susceptible to words and language in general -- most don&#39;t realize how little information is actually encoded in messages, and when you compress a lot of &quot;good&quot; ideas into a short space, it can potentially have a sort of hypnotic effect. If done with ill intent, the results can be disastrous (or even with good intent; see above).</p>
      <p>It&#39;s these properties of writing as an art form; strong effect, little discipline needed; that breed into you over time a very thick layer of skepticism toward people that are suspiciously good at words. Older people understand this better than I do; it&#39;s deeds, not words, that warrant trust and admiration from people who want something from you, or that you want to build some kind of relationship with.</p>
      <p>The best way you can get &quot;what you want&quot; out of reading and writing is just by getting a sense for who someone is. Personal accounts are infinitely better than abstract ideas in this regard. But even then, unless someone is extremely prolific and has written a lot, you still can&#39;t fully trust the slice of experience they&#39;re deciding to share with you. Prolificness is a really key indicator though; I&#39;ve met never met him, but I strongly assume that Stephen King is a generally good guy -- if only because he&#39;s clearly too busy writing all those damn books to get up to no good elsewhere in his life.</p>
      <p>===</p>
      <p>Finally, people write because they&#39;re a &quot;lonely egotistical maniac who can&#39;t shut up&quot;. Okay, I&#39;m being a little harsh here.</p>
      <p>I say &quot;lonely&quot; because, well, it&#39;s usually not worthwhile to produce good art if you&#39;re healthily engaged in performing duties and maintaining relationships that you&#39;re supposed to be doing. If you&#39;re not writing because you want something specific, or out of a misguided sense of helping people, you&#39;re doing it because you just <em>have</em> thoughts and you <em>need</em> to express them, dammit; you feel <em>compelled</em> to, even when you suspect it might be a bad idea.</p>
      <p>It can be because there are few people who understand you enough to feel like you&#39;re fully expressing yourself in the web of relationships that keep you sane, grounded, and human. It can be because you&#39;ve had a lot of &quot;interesting experiences&quot; (see last post) that you still need to wrestle with. (Therapy is probably better than writing for this purpose, but finding a good therapist is basically &quot;as NP-hard&quot; as connecting to other lonely people through the written word). Flatly, I think Soren Kierkegaard puts it best:</p>
      <p>&quot;What is a poet? An unhappy person who conceals profound anguish in his heart, but whose lips are so formed that as sighs and cries pass over them they sound like beautiful music...</p>
      <p>And the people crowd around the poet and say to him: &quot;Sing again soon!&quot; -- in other words, may new sufferings torture your soul, and may your lips continue to be formed as before, because your screams would only alarm us, but the music is charming.&quot;</p>
      <p>Secondly, &quot;egotistical&quot;. I actually have no idea what an ego is. Everyone has too much of an ego, but also they have too little. Is ego your whole self, or just a part of yourself? I honestly have no clue, and I don&#39;t care; not my area of expertise, and also it&#39;s probably a stupid question. (For what it&#39;s worth, the best definition of ego I&#39;ve heard is from my dad; ego just means &quot;edge God out&quot;).</p>
      <p>I think what most people mean when they say someone is &quot;egotistical&quot; is just that they&#39;re not being humble. Being humble is super hard; I&#39;m not very good at it, but try to practice it every day. I don&#39;t really have any advice for being humble, other than constantly acknowledging that you&#39;re actually just not very cool, you&#39;re not very smart, and you&#39;re about as powerful as a cute little snapping turtle in the grand scheme of things.</p>
      <p>I say &quot;maniacal&quot; because writing is actually just a little mentally challenging. It actually does require grit, courage, and deep spiritual soundness. Writing about personal things that are important to you makes you <em>vulnerable</em>. If you record what&#39;s happening in your head onto a paper or a screen, you&#39;re giving everybody else a window into your soul. In general, this is a very bad idea! Maybe you need to have exactly one screw loose to pull it off correctly, reaping the benefits while minimize harm (to yourself and others). It can be very slightly scary sometimes, which is why most writers who do it a lot don&#39;t write about very personal stuff, or do it only rarely.</p>
      <p>This gets glorified way too often, IMO; I am extremely for having all of your screws completely tightened at all times, and getting too personal too often is just flatly a little ugly. If producing good art requires you to be a little crazy, choose sanity every time. I will say this; in the best version of producing excellent art of any kind, you do it to honor God.</p>
      <p>===</p>
      <p>Anyway, those are some of my thoughts on writing. Thank you for reading. And sorry if I hijacked your attention; as stated, it is rude and I apologize.</p>
      <p>If you&#39;re curious, here&#39;s a short list of writers who have influenced me deeply over the course of my life:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Paul Graham</li>
      <li>Michael Crichton</li>
      <li>Venkatesh Rao</li>
      <li>Soren Kierkegaard</li>
      <li>David Wong</li>
      <li>Scott Alexander</li>
      <li>George R.R. Martin</li>
      <li>Sarah Perry</li>
      <li>Stephen King</li>
      <li>Joel Spolsky</li>
      <li>[this space left intentionally blank; another highly influential blogger]</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To most of them, I express the deepest gratitude. To others, I say &quot;fuck you&quot;. Still not really sure which is which.</p>

      <br />

      <p><strong>Mon May 25</strong></p>
      <p>To live a good life -- to have deep satisfaction, to help others, and to exercise your will while minimizing external harm -- you must do one of two things. You either adjust to the small town you grew up in, or you have interesting experiences (and survive them).</p>
      <p>I think most people who have lived interesting lives would agree that the first path is preferable; listen to your parents, do good in school, have good health, cherish those around you, pay attention to the small things. There&#39;s an old Chinese saying -- &quot;<em>may you live in interesting times&quot;</em> -- that is actually intended as a curse on your enemies. (Apparently, this is apocryphal; whatever).</p>
      <p>The consolation prize of doing interesting things is that hardship does, indeed, breed character. You grow stronger. You grow more flexible. If you&#39;re lucky, your heart does not become dimmer; in fact it can become as bright as ever. The only thing you wasted is time, which you can never recover.</p>
      <p>If you couldn&#39;t fit into the small town you grew up and just <em>had</em> to see the world, make mistakes, and &#39;learn things the hard way&#39;, one thing you might notice is that each new experience or hardship starts to bring you less and less growth. It becomes extremely expensive (in terms of time wasted and risk incurred) to learn each new lesson. For me, it took about 1.5 years to learn my last big lesson (Lord willing). I won&#39;t get into the details, but the upshot is that my health deteriorated, many relationships were put on pause, my financial trajectory was waylaid, and it generally sucked huge hard monkey balls.</p>
      <p>I didn&#39;t even learn anything specific; just another stupid lesson in humility, and a putting together of things I&#39;ve already learned in a way that makes sense for my life. Things became clearer for a while, and then they became muddied, and then clearer again, and then finally to a state I like to call <em>comfortably muddied.</em> Looking back on the myriad mistakes I made in my 20s, and having survived them almost entirely due to sheer luck, I must say that I am glad I made them, and would be very glad to avoid making major mistakes in the future.</p>
      <p>Life is indeed much more enjoyable after growing as much as you need to. Yesterday I talked to a guy who took a gig just watching a bonfire for 7 hours. How did he do that? I would get so bored. (He also told me he took another gig killing coyotes, at $50 per coyote, which sounds like something out of an old West movie). Another guy traveled around the country, rigging up fiber cables for presidential speeches. He currently works on retrofitting alternative fuel vehicles that run on compressed natural gas. I learned later that his father collected player pianos (pianos that play themselves, or something; to be honest, I was a little distracted by the pretty girl at our table, who wasn&#39;t interested in talking; I probably seem too intense).</p>
      <p>Overall, life is good. There&#39;s a lot of boring stuff I&#39;d like to take care of (health, relationships, money, networking, finding the perfect apartment), but I guess I&#39;m comfortable doing the whole <em>writer / philosopher / observer</em> cliche every once in a while.</p>
      <p>Okay, hell, a couple lessons I guess.</p>
      <p>One is that being a millennial digital-native-computer-addict is a uniquely hard generational challenge that most old people don&#39;t understand. You&#39;re used to things going super fast. if you want to get a piece of information, cycle through 1,000 people hotter than you on instagram, or read the hottest deep state conspiracies, it&#39;s all available to you. But the old people are fundamentally right; <em>you&#39;ve got to slow the hell down</em>. Prayer and meditation work wonders. Listen to birds, learn <a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Do-Nothing-Resisting-Attention/dp/1612197493">how to do nothing</a>. But also remember to keep yourself busy, and that time is a precious resource. Patience is a virtue, and it is both harder and more intellectually challenging than it may appear.</p>
      <p>The second virtue that I know about is kindness. All hats off to Vonnegut; <em> <strong>god dammit, you&#39;ve got to be kind</strong> </em>. Many people have been tremendously kind to me over the course of my life, and I would like to pay that back by being kind to others. Kindness really makes the world go &#39;round, and it&#39;s more important than ever if you are cursed with living in interesting times.</p>
      <p>Kindness and patience are virtues because they&#39;re things that you must do, even if you don&#39;t want to do them.</p>
      <p class="mb200">Have a good memorial day.</p>
      <p>(this is a player piano, by the way)</p>
