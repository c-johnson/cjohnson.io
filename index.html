        <p><strong>Sat July 4</strong></p>
        <p><em>On being a good citizen</em>, or, <em>an antidote to doomerism</em>, or, <em>in response to Mencius Moldbug</em></p>
        <p>Every system of political thought in the world seems to be trending toward some form of totalitarianism. The ascension of the CCP has presented a new challenge to the Western idea of power formally derived from the people; both &quot;neoreaction&quot; and &quot;the dirtbag left&quot;, two nascent internet ideologies (representing right- and left-wing viewpoints respectively), push heavily anti-democratic attitudes. The rest of the world is seeing various brewing dictatorships in Brazil, Russia, eastern Europe, India, Turkey...</p>
        <p>.... and maybe even The United States.</p>
        <p>For almost a century, it appeared as though democracy had won. The end of history had been declared; capitalist liberal democracy is the answer, and every state should have formal constitutional mechanisms wherein elected officials are replaced via a trustworthy voting system, supervised by untethered financial markets. The two major challenges to democracy in the 20th century -- facism and communism -- were defeated handily by the United States, in the corresponding wars with Nazi Germany and the USSR.</p>
        <p>Crucially, however, these were not <em>philosophical</em> victories; they were economic and military ones. While a very strong case was later retconned into the global discourse that the <em>ideas</em> of capitalist democracy were what triumphed, it has been far from conclusively *proven*; indeed, during the last decade, this premise has come under serious widespread scrutiny.</p>
        <p>I&#39;d make an even stronger statement; between the end of the cold war and the election of Donald Trump, the case for liberal democracy has been almost completely demolished. The global spread of Americanism in the latter half of the 20th century is now viewed by serious observers as an abject failure. The incredible naivete of our ruling elites, that we could simply transplant our Anglo-American notions of governance, law, and economics to every polity across the world has been shown to be nothing short of geopolitical insanity. Russia in the 90s is a great case study; our philosophical imperialism primarily served to just create mass chaos, which quickly resulted in consolidation of power by brutal strongmen. Every system can be gamed, and every tradition needs to evolve patiently over a long period of time, in respect to the local conditions and history of the people living there, to have a chance of being successful. Simply put, we did not do that, and we are now facing the consequences.</p>
        <p>Western countries on both sides of the Atlantic now face a deep PR crisis in justifying its system of government, not only to the rest of the world, but crucially, its own citizens, who have been ravaged by inequality, left flat-footed by the information age, and have mostly been resting on their laurels after their sweeping victories in the 20th century.</p>
        <p>Totalitarianism is easy enough to understand; one person or party controls everything, and the people either put up with it, climb their way up the court ladder, form an armed resistance, or try to leave. Americans have been taught from birth that totalitarianism sucks, and I&#39;m inclined to believe it; I, for one, am pretty bad at all of that stuff.</p>
        <p>For what it&#39;s worth, there are plenty of examples in history of people flourishing under totalitarian systems. Rome itself abandoned its republican facade halfway through its lifespan; the <em>pax romana</em> was widely regarded by historians as a pretty good place to live for a while. China itself, maintaining a blend of strong centralized power and Confucian values over its long history, has enjoyed many periods of peace, prosperity, and relative stability, which is especially impressive given its incredible population size. (The only problem with the Chinese system is what they call the <em>bad emperor</em> problem; what do you do if the guy in charge sucks? They still haven&#39;t seemed to crack that one.)</p>
        <p>But what is &quot;democracy&quot;, though? The scare quotes around this term are hard won. Outside of a few shining examples in smaller, simpler polities in ancient Greece and Rome, I would make the case that true democracy (or republicanism, or its other flavors) have rarely been seriously tried. Especially since the invention of mass media, it&#39;s becoming clear to serious observers that the democratic nature of our political systems is much more a liability than it is an asset.</p>
        <p>In the United States, the poster child for the &quot;success&quot; of modern &quot;democratic&quot; systems, the system only ever &quot;worked&quot; when it was restricted to a small subset of the overall polity: White, land-owning men. Obviously, this tended to be a raw deal for non-white, non-male, non-landowners. But a curious thing happened as enfranchisement was gradually expanded to these other groups; while people of all classes gained the right to vote, the levers of power -- chiefly, economic strength and cultural influence -- remained mysteriously out of grasp. Economic inequality has soared to the highest levels in history, with no hope of abatement. And cultural influence…</p>
        <p>The truth is that actual <strong>power</strong> was never conferred to these groups, but to a network of media, educational, and bureaucratic institutions that Noam Chomsky first identified as <em>consent manufacturers,</em> and Mencius Moldbug later coined as the Cathedral. From the perspective of cynical power politics, the Cathedral primarily exists as a sieve; its goal is to channel public opinion into a state of constant disorientation, and its MO is to distract, divide, and placate the populace, allowing those in power to do whatever it is they wanted to do in the first place.</p>
        <p>It&#39;s worth noting that &quot;the Cathedral&quot;, if it has any worth as a concept, is an emergent phenomenon, not some kind of intentional dastardly plan or conspiracy. It persists because it functions well in its purposes:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Preventing the <em>hoi polloi</em> from recognizing (and thus taking steps to achieve) true political and economic power</li>
        <li>Severing people&#39;s connection to their survival instincts and obscuring useful models of base reality, making them reliant on the state.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>With that said, I&#39;ll go ahead and make a bold stance here. Unlike Moldbug and Chomsky, I&#39;m not sure that the Cathedral is an entirely bad thing.</p>
        <p>For starters, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessary or even good for every citizen to have to constantly confront the dastardly problems of managing reality. I think most people can lead good, productive lives, without actually having to get deeply invested in the core problems of statecraft, cultural flourishing, supply chain logistics, and stewardship over themselves. In the harshest view, the Cathedral &quot;tells people what to think&quot; in order for elites to retain power; but there are much more benign versions possible. In an ideal world, our civic institutions are composed of a truly responsible nobility, which acts as a middleman to communicate new information and changing circumstances to a citizenry that is busy doing the other things they need to do with their life.</p>
        <p>For modern democracy to have a chance of working, we need some form of &quot;cathedral&quot;, but it should be <em>good</em>, and it should both serve and be actually accountable to the people. Democratic nations should have strong media institutions, strong educational organizations, effective altruism initiatives, and efficient bureaucracies. (I have some thoughts near the end about how we might get there).</p>
        <p>Secondly, as identified in the federalist papers, pure democracy doesn&#39;t actually work. &quot;Mob mentality&quot; is a thing. Democracies are better implemented as <em>republics</em>, and they should have many intricate mechanisms that slow things down and act as a counter to the constant sway of public opinion. Checks and balances, an electoral college, a hierarchy of elected representatives, relatively clandestine party selection mechanisms, and various other tricks and tools of the trade should act as strong gatekeepers, making sure that challenges to existing authorities must overcome significant hurdles if they aim to make significant changes.</p>
        <p>Lastly, in any working system of government, power should remain relatively stable. Even if your constitutional mechanisms do a great job of slowing everything down, positive change that&#39;s done in a responsible manner is always going to be way slower than people expect. There needs to be some measure of faith from the people that the people in charge are acting in their best interests, that they know what they&#39;re doing, and that they&#39;re working as fast as they can to address pressing issues of public welfare. This is the primary weakness of democratic systems overall, and it&#39;s heavily contrasted with our experience in other domains, like business and technology, which are ferociously obsessed with satiating customers as soon as possible (perhaps at the expense of their long-term wellbeing).</p>
        <p>For developing new technology, philosophies like <em>move fast and break things</em> are a great idea. As a governing philosophy, I cannot think of anything more terrible. No matter what system of politics you live under, there&#39;s a certain point where the people and the government have to trust each other. I think I speak for almost everyone when I say that this is certainly not the case in 2020 USA.</p>
        <p>==</p>
        <p>As stated, it takes an incredible number of things to go right for democracy to work. Totalitarianism is comparatively easy; one organization maintains strict military &amp; cultural control over the populace, and that&#39;s that. You can learn the essential dynamics from watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rStL7niR7gs">a short youtube video</a>.</p>
        <p>It&#39;s important to note that I, personally, have no idea about which system is fundamentally better. I am not a historian, I am not a political philosopher, and I think such questions are, by their nature, unanswerable to any satisfactory degree. This essay will not even try to give a good answer. This essay is scoped to a much easier question: <em> <strong>given</strong> </em> <em>that we want to continue pursuing democracy, how should we try to maximize its chances of survival and flourishing?</em></p>
        <p>Incidentally, I do think that we (Americans living in 2020) should continue pursuing democracy. Why? Because America is an experiment, and we should see the experiment out to the end. And for that experiment to actually be useful, that means we should actually start trying.</p>
        <p>We can start with an even more specific question than that. Power in a democracy is derived from the people. The fundamental unit of effectiveness, then -- the lynchpin upon which everything else rests -- is the <em>citizen</em>. For democracy to work, we need to come to an agreement on <em>what makes a good citizen</em>, and then we, collectively, need to try to be better citizens. And then we need to start drafting policy and building institutions that have the explicit purpose of helping people become better citizens.</p>
        <p>==</p>
        <p>Without getting too etymological on you, &quot;citizen&quot; (and its cousin English words; &quot;city&quot;, &quot;civil&quot;, &quot;civics&quot;, &quot;civilization&quot;) is derived from many latin root words: <em>civitas</em>, <em>civis</em>, <em>cives</em>, <em>civilis</em>. To spare you a boring language history discussion, I&#39;ll offer some succinct definitions:</p>
        <p>Being <em>civil</em> means getting along with people very different from you.</p>
        <p>Living in a <em>city</em> means sharing resources, negotiating policy, and stewarding a community with a large number of diverse others.</p>
        <p>A <em>citizen</em> is a subject of a larger unit than the <em>city</em>, typically a nation-state.</p>
        <p>A <em>civilization</em> is the largest social organization shared by people with even the remotest sociopolitical similarities to each other. There are only a few <em>civilizations</em>; one typography was offered by Samuel Huntington in his seminal work <em>Clash of Civilizations</em>. Obviously, the boundaries here are extremely fuzzy:</p>
        <p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/Clash_of_Civilizations_mapn2.png" alt="Clash of civilizations map" style="width: 100%"></p>
        <p>(Question for future discussion: Should there be a unit of organization larger than a civilization?)</p>
        <p>And, finally, <em>civics</em> is the study of all of the above.</p>
        <p>I&#39;m going to do us all a favor and skip over a belaboring of what these terms actually mean. That&#39;s stuff that academics love to do, and I am definitely not an academic. To reiterate, our discussion focuses on the following proposition, and corresponding question:</p>
        <p>Proposition: If democracy has a chance of working, it needs <em>good citizens</em><br />
        Question: What makes a <em>good citizen</em>?</p>
        <p>For our purposes, I&#39;m going to explore what this means in context of ourcivilization: The liberal, democratic, capitalist, Western world. Many of these qualities and suggestions may apply in other types of civilizations, but they are not our focus. And as stated in part 2, the qualities of being an effective <em>citizen</em> should bleed seamlessly into the ancient philosophical question of <em>how to live a good life</em>. Even if you strip away all of the implications about politics, this is just my best advice in general for how to live, regardless of your system of government or whether you even care about its survival.</p>
        <p>==</p>
        <p>Without further ado, let&#39;s jump in.</p>
        <p>A good citizen has the following qualities:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Basic adulting skills</li>
        <li>Emotional intelligence</li>
        <li>Good attention management</li>
        <li>Articulative</li>
        <li>Well-traveled</li>
        <li>Tolerant</li>
        <li>Humble</li>
        <li>Respecting of the rule of law</li>
        <li>Effective</li>
        <li>Servitude</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each of these qualities represents an ideal end-state, but the responsibility for achieving a healthy citizenry is fundamentally a team effort. Chiefly, it is an individual&#39;s duty to be the best citizen they can be, given the cards they are dealt. But it is also the job of their family to raise them well, provide for material needs, and guide them mentally and emotionally. It is the job of a community to offer a robust environment for them to develop, cut their teeth on challenging experiences, meet friends and partners, and gain useful employment. And it is the job of a state to protect them from foreign adversaries, procure neutral infrastructure, provide for the general welfare, foster these qualities in its subjects to the best of its ability, and finally, to trust them to fully participate as equal partners in the political process.</p>
        <p>This list is definitely aspirational; pretty much nobody will be able to maintain a stable set of these attributes, and the process of active citizenship should persist well past an individual&#39;s lifespan. I myself am certainly not the best citizen I could be; I suffer from many problems with <em>basic adulting</em>, <em>attention management, humility</em>, and, increasingly, <em>tolerance</em>. Some of these qualities are easy to achieve when you&#39;re younger (tolerance, emotional intelligence), and some of these almost inevitably arise out of achieving old age (basic adulting, humility). In particular, the quality of being <em>well-traveled</em> is a very hard and challenging demand that most people simply won&#39;t have the opportunity to develop.</p>
        <p>It&#39;s my opinion that the current cohort of American citizens -- especially young people -- are in a state of troubling disrepair. I have no exact prescription for how we get from A to B, but in the final section, we&#39;ll discuss some ideas for what it takes to make good citizens. We&#39;ll end with some thoughts about what we do next.</p>
        <p>==</p>
        <p><strong>Basic adulting</strong>, also known as <em>taking care of your own shit</em>. An adult human should be empowered to take care of their own health, finances, relationships, hobbies, and ambitions. They should be employed doing something useful and productive, and have a healthy stream of income. They should have a sensible diet, get a decent amount of exercise, have access to regular physical check-ups, and have a dynamic support network of people and activities that let them maintain good mental health. They should either be already involved in a fulfilling romantic relationship, or have a baseline sense of their own attractiveness and dateability, primarily with the goal of eventually starting a family. Ideally, they have some amount of time to have fun, slack off, and explore things interesting to them. Finally, they have some kind of path toward the self-actualization of their own ambitions; some kind of thing they want to build, group they want to caretake, art they want to produce, or otherwise some kind of unique contribution to the world that persists beyond their death; some kind of legacy.</p>
        <p>As with most of these qualities, there are a zillion ways to think about what <em>being an adult</em> means (and most of this list overlaps with the question), but these are what I consider to be the absolute basics. If you have a shitty job that constantly stresses you out and pays you nothing, it&#39;ll be incredibly hard to do anything else mentioned here. If you&#39;re constantly stricken by chronic health issues, overcoming those will probably be the primary concern of your life. If you&#39;re a hopeless incel utterly doomed in your own romantic prospects, none of this abstract shit is ever going to matter to you. Probably the chief way that America of 2020 fails its subjects is its utter negligence of how incredibly hard it is to be a basic ordinary adult who&#39;s just trying to get by. Pretty much every other country eats us by a long mile in this regard.</p>
        <p>There are, of course, a zillion other resources available for an aspiring <em>basic adult</em> to consider. There are many good-hearted leaders offering ideas for <em>self-help</em>, or groups and organizations willing to provide various kinds of support. However, most of these avenues come at the cost of some kind of political or spiritual allegiance; or, in the case of self-help authors, come at the cost of your own mental independence. It is the responsibility of the state and your local / regional community to be utterly concerned with this problem, and their continued failure to do so will mark the continued failure of democratic civics as a whole; until this roadblock is overcome, nothing else on this list will matter.</p>
        <p><strong>Emotional intelligence</strong>. Here&#39;s where most functional adults start to fail. For some reason, the concept of emotional intelligence seems to have been absent from most theories of personal development in Western societies. I expect many societies have been so concerned with survival they haven&#39;t really had time to consider emotional balance as a crucial part of thriving. Traditionally, this area seems to have been primarily relegated to the role of women in society. Women are supposed to be the caretakers; their job is to handle all of that <em>emotion</em> stuff.</p>
        <p>This is no longer acceptable for democratic societies in the 21st century. <em>Everybody</em> needs to be able to care about emotions now. Another way to chunk up the big story of the 20th century is that information technology (starting with mass media) has completely revolutionized the transfer of emotional information and experience to larger and larger audiences. Before the 1900s, no other polity has ever had to reckon with the great and terrible power of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO9d2PpP7tQ">Sarah Mclachlan ad</a>. We can now feel pain, anger, sadness, and joy from thousands of miles away, and the intersection of this huge increase in emotion with our socioculturopolitical systems has been incredibly hard to reckon with.</p>
        <p>It&#39;s important to note that emotional intelligence has two categories: Noticing emotions in <em>others</em>, and recognizing emotions in <em>yourself</em>. Being &quot;empathetic&quot; usually refers to just the first part, and it&#39;s really not that hard to do; contrary to popular belief, everybody has the capacity for basic empathy. But accruing life experience helps you realize just how easily emotional appeals can be extremely rude and manipulative. Many people develop strong self-defense mechanisms against blatant pulling of their heart-strings. When I see a Sarah Mclachlan ad nowadays, I change the channel in disgust; I already know there are suffering animals out there, man, I&#39;m just trying to focus on getting shit done, okay?</p>
        <p>Recognizing emotions in <em>yourself</em> is an entirely different beast, and one that I think a disturbingly large number of people lack. When you encounter something that makes you feel strongly, it takes a large amount of discipline, experience, and instinct to immediately start interrogating <em>yourself</em> on exactly what it is you&#39;re feeling, <em>why</em> you&#39;re feeling that way, and what an appropriate response should be.</p>
        <p>I&#39;d identify this as probably the main problem when young people engage in political discourse. The pattern usually plays out something like this; stop me if it sounds familiar:</p>
        <p>1) Somebody makes a political statement.</p>
        <p>2) What they said makes me feel &quot;icky&quot;.</p>
        <p>3) Therefore, that person is at fault.</p>
        <p>4) Therefore, I publicly charge that person as being <em>bad</em>, and recommend they be rebuked, silenced, threatened, or destroyed.</p>
        <p>In logical terms, this response is absurd. Given our evolutionary history, however, it&#39;s pretty much the natural response to encountering people or ideas that make you feel weird. If someone thinks differently from you, or if they dress weird, they must be a bad person. When people refer to <em>tribalism</em>, I think they&#39;re simplifying a lot of ideas into this basic pattern. America&#39;s two-party system is pretty much built on this basic psychological foundation.</p>
        <p>In my humble opinion, this pattern of response sucks, and we should strive to eradicate it from civil discourse. And it&#39;s not only a problem with young people; a <em>disturbingly</em> large number of otherwise very intelligent individuals, well into their old age, display this kind of shit response all the time. If the experience of <em>feeling empathy for others</em> should be universal, so too should the ability to identify your own emotions, and separate them from your reasoning capabilities.</p>
        <p><strong>Attention management.</strong></p>
        <p>The information age has exposed another critical dimension to human activity that has so far been vastly undertheorized in political philosophy; the crucial, limited resource of <em>attention</em>. If you&#39;ve been paying attention (heh heh) to developments in the business models of Silicon Valley, you may be familiar with the phrase <em>attention economy</em>. Social media tech giants have built gargantuan, world-shaking business empires on the backs of capturing and monetizing attention; Google, Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, even the Chinese government (through Tiktok). Not only have these companies accrued hundreds of billions of dollars, they command a vast apparatus of political and cultural influence, chiefly due to having a decades-long head start on the science of hijacking human minds for their own purposes.</p>
        <p>As a citizen, attention is the most valuable resource you have. Personally, it is utterly depressing to see how much of it gets wasted on absolute nonsense. In a healthy system, most people should spend &gt;95% of their attention on ordinary adulting, and probably less than 5% of it on social and political issues. If there&#39;s some kind of meta societal problem everybody should be aware of and focusing on, it is this.</p>
        <p>It all started with advertising. At some point in Western civilization, we decided it was totally okay for arbitrary people to completely hijack your attention, anywhere and everywhere, as long as it was in the service of trying to sell you a product. I can&#39;t begin to describe how bonkersly stupid this decision has been for civil health. Bill Hicks, while I can&#39;t condone his particular phrasing, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHEOGrkhDp0">was essentially right</a>. We didn&#39;t listen, and look where we are now.</p>
        <p>Check out this description of the effects of <em>Cidade Limpa</em>, the law adopted by the city of Sao Paulo which banned all outdoor advertising:</p>
        <p><em>São Paulo is a very vertical city. That makes it very frenetic. You could not even realize the architecture of the old buildings, because all the buildings, all the houses were just covered with billboards and logos and propaganda. And there was no criteria. And now it is amazing. They uncovered a lot of problems the city had that we never realized. For example, there are some favelas, which are the shantytowns. I wrote a big story in my newspaper today that in a lot of parts of the city we never realized there was a big shantytown. People were shocked because they never saw that before, just because there were a lot of billboards covering the area. São Paulo is just like New York. It is a very</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiculturalism"><em>multicultural</em></a><em>,</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globalization"><em>globalized</em></a> <em>city. We have</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japantown"><em>the Japanese neighborhood</em></a><em>, we have</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koreatown"><em>the Korean neighborhood</em></a><em>, we have</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Italy"><em>the Italian neighborhood</em></a> <em>and in the Korean neighborhood, they have a lot of small manufacturers, these Korean businessmen. They hire illegal labor from Bolivian immigrants. And there was a lot of billboards in front of these manufacturers&#39; shops. And when they uncovered, we could see through the window a lot of Bolivian people like sleeping and working at the same place. They earn money, just enough for food. So it is a big social problem that was uncovered, and the city was shocked by these news.</em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cidade_Limpa#cite_note-3"><em>[3]</em></a></p>
        <p>Every citizen needs a crash course in managing their own attention. But there&#39;s also an important flipside to this; as a citizen, it is your duty to respect other citizens&#39; limited attention resources. You should minimize the amount of noise you make, and you should practice <a href="https://cjohnson.io/#time-to-grow-up"><em>shutting the fuck up</em></a>. In the world of programming, this key advice is described by one of the most important rules of the Unix philosophy, the rule of silence:</p>
        <p><em>When a</em> <a href="http://www.linfo.org/program.html"><em>program</em></a> <em>has nothing surprising, interesting or useful to say, it should say nothing.</em></p>
        <p>This is especially important if you are advocating a specific political message you feel strongly about. This failure mode of political activism calls to mind the fable of <em>The Boy Who Cried Wolf</em>. When you draw a bunch of attention to yourself about a problem you&#39;re passionate about, and it turns out the problem is grossly exaggerated, nonexistent, already known, or otherwise inactionable, you torpedo your own credibility in making further proclamations about pressing problems. If you want your message to be taken seriously, you need to take extra care that you&#39;ve identified the problem correctly, you&#39;ve expressed it in the proper forum at the proper time, that you&#39;re adding something unique to the conversation, and that your expression is well-articulated.</p>
        <p><strong>Articulative.</strong> Articulation, at its core, is the practical technique of respecting other people&#39;s attention when communicating. Roughly speaking, it&#39;s the ability to form your thoughts into brief, clear sentences.</p>
        <p>For some reason or another, people vary wildly in their ability to be articulate. It is one of the hardest skills to train. But not everybody has to be an expert writer or speaker; the prescription for being a good citizen is just to <em>articulate your thoughts and feelings as best as you can</em>.</p>
        <p>There are actually some intractable problems at the core of how we use language. In an abstract sense, it&#39;s frankly a miracle that anything of substance is able to be communicated at all. As humans rose from the mud, we ostensibly started with grunts, screaming, and pointing at things to get our message across. Eventually we developed the ability to form phonemes, utterances, graphemes, hieroglyphs, and then eventually letters, words, and sentences. To this day, it&#39;s completely baffling and impressive how weird and complicated language is, the ability of babies to universally develop speaking and writing skills is still an open question that we don&#39;t have many good answers for.</p>
        <p>It&#39;s important to remind ourselves that mass literacy is still relatively new. For ages, only a very select few had the ability and education to render anything of complexity into the written word. In the ideal version of society, there should be something called an <em>education system</em> that guides and teaches young humans in the use of language. If you&#39;ve followed any of my earlier writings or developments as a young smartiepants, I think our current education system is terrible, horrible, and no good.</p>
        <p>For some reason, when we teach language arts in primary school, and continue onto advanced studies in college, everyone seems focused on teaching a kind of formalized, abstract, and historical version of language that contemporary speakers have long moved past. If you&#39;re one of those &quot;spelling/grammar nazis&quot;, this essay series has probably infuriated you. I pay almost no respect to the &quot;academic&quot;, &quot;precise&quot;, or &quot;correct&quot; usage of words, and this type of study is not only a vestigial waste of time, it&#39;s a direct hindrance to our collective ability to communicate issues of critical civic importance. (Strictly as a hobby, or as an interest of the 0.1% of people who are serious historical scholars, I have no problem with it).</p>
        <p>It&#39;s totally okay to misuse words, or make up new ones, or redefine existing words for your present purposes. I think this is another thing that the Internet has broken wide open in our possibility space. Nobody will tell you this, but you have permission to use language however you like; it&#39;s totally fine, and all the cool kids are doing it. Just try to communicate your thoughts and feelings the best you can. Suffice to say, <a href="http://cjohnson.io/#writing">writing</a> is the #1 superpower available to you to persuade others to care about important issues. The better you can write, the more influence you will have, although the caveats of writing outlined above always apply.</p>
        <p>One last thing to note is that there may be some natural limit on how articulate a specific person can be. I&#39;m very cautious about drawing conclusions of individual ability based on immutable characteristics, given the primacy and complexity that education, poverty, culture, and circumstance play into childhood development. But even minimal amounts of articulation can have a huge impact. Even if you don&#39;t form the best words, if you inhabit the other qualities of citizenship well enough, your voice can be hugely influential; the example of Malala Yousafzai comes to mind.</p>
        <p><strong>Well-traveled.</strong> In a recent post, I wrote the following:</p>
        <p><em>To live a good life -- to have deep satisfaction, to help others, and to exercise your will while minimizing external harm -- you must do one of two things. You either adjust to the small town you grew up in, or you have interesting experiences (and survive them).</em></p>
        <p>A very brutal truth to human development is that painful, challenging, risky, and even destructive hardships are essential to growth. It&#39;s hard to speak about this in clinical terms; for the individual undergoing extreme suffering, the &quot;don&#39;t worry, it&#39;ll make you stronger!&quot; refrain is no consolation. To be even harsher, undergoing incredible pain is not even a <em>guarantee</em> of growth; contrary to Nietzsche, it&#39;s not true that near-lethal damage necessarily makes you stronger. I recall the opening scene of <em>House of Cards</em>, as Frank Underwood contemplates euthanizing a maimed dog:</p>
        <p>&quot;There are two kinds of pain. The sort of pain that makes you strong. Or useless pain. The sort of pain that&#39;s only suffering. I have no patience for useless things.&quot;</p>
        <p>There is a deep ethical paradox here; suffering, as we all agree, completely sucks, but society needs strong men and women to function. It is a very weird thing to say &quot;society has a justified interest in seeing you suffer&quot;, as our strongest universal moral precepts are in unanimous agreement that intentionally inflicting harm upon another person is a bad thing to do.</p>
        <p>Luckily, most people are very good at self-inflicting harm to themselves without the need for outside intervention. But some are born in a position where they are never challenged hard enough to be driven to the brink of real destruction; the risky venture of the soul that completely wipes you out, inspires deep reflection, and catalyzes self-actualization into a stronger, kinder, wiser person. It is very easy to identify such <em>sweet summer children</em>.</p>
        <p>Eventually, time crushes us all. Many are blessed enough to put off their <em>mid-life crisis</em> until they reach their 30s or 40s. But from the unfortunate perspective of civics, it is better if this process happens earlier rather than later.</p>
        <p>We are rightfully forbidden to inflict intentional harm on another person; even with the &quot;noble&quot; intention of inspiring growth. It is simply not your place to make that decision for someone else. Even as a parent, the best thing you can do is let your child make risky mistakes, fall on their heads, and learn from it on their own (I&#39;m not a parent, but I imagine it is incredibly difficult to do this!).</p>
        <p>As a society, the next best thing we can encourage nascent citizens to do is to travel.</p>
        <p>Traveling is extremely good for the civic soul. And of course, there are distinctions; every world explorer knows the difference between being a <em>tourist</em> and being a <em>traveller</em>. Simply visiting a foreign place is not enough; what&#39;s required is a prolonged <em>disconnection</em> from one&#39;s home culture. To strip away your social connections, patterns of living, coping mechanisms, and ways of life, and to face the square problems of basic survival with minimal outside help. For my own case, I only travelled for 4 months in Asia, when I was 23 years old. I cannot recommend this enough; it is a profoundly enriching and exhilarating experience. For a couple months, the only questions of importance for me were <em>where am I sleeping tonight</em>, and <em>where will I get food</em>, and <em>what the hell are these weird sores on my feet, is there even a decent hospital around here, holy shit I&#39;m so fucked what am I doing here</em>.</p>
        <p>I am beyond blessed and grateful that I didn&#39;t do something fatally stupid, and escaped with minimal long-term damage. There was one situation where I was in the jungle, and a friend and I took a detour off the path…</p>
        <p>Okay, I&#39;ll spare you my travel stories. Suffice to say that travelling breeds <em>character</em>, and I think there is some quality to this character that is essential to being the best citizen that you can be.</p>
        <p>Traveling can be highly disorienting, and when you eventually return home, there&#39;s often a period of what&#39;s called <em>reverse culture shock</em> as you integrate back into your normal way of life. This is usually painful and isolating; out on your own, you experience a lot of interesting and fascinating things that are simply not communicable to your friends, family, and loved ones. But when the process is completed, you&#39;ll be very glad you did it, and all the wiser for it.</p>
        <p>I shouldn&#39;t overplay the harms of traveling; the ordinary joy of experiencing cultures vastly different from your own is commensurable. As we defined earlier, living in a <em>city</em> means getting along with people different from you. Diversity is a real strength in a functioning democratic polity. Toleration of others, with deep differences in behavior, beliefs, and attitude -- mediated by rational, liberal discourse -- is a fundamental necessity to civic thriving.</p>
        <p><strong>Tolerant.</strong> Sorry, one more travel story. When I first landed in South Korea, I was completely, thoroughly awe-struck. It&#39;s hard to give the experience its due respect; my first day in Busan was probably the best 24 hours of my life. The sheer fun of nightlife there is incomprehensible to Americans; tens of thousands of young people swarming through intricate neighborhoods and alleyways, a nonstop party that goes well past 6am. Innumerable food stalls selling tteokbokki, pajeon, gimbap, alongside more ordinary fares of delicious BBQ and fried chicken. Every third business in the party neighborhoods was a 24-hour LAN center or a small karaoke bar. The first time I bought a beer at a corner store and drank it outside, I felt true shame as an American; <em>this is actually what real freedom feels like!</em>. (Koreans drink like no other nation; I recall a stat that, at some point, the small country of South Korea consumes something like 25% of the world&#39;s volume of liquor).</p>
        <p>Even back in 2014, the amount of technology, convenience, and sheer progress of civilization was stunning to me. It truly felt like I had time-traveled into the future from some kind of dark age. New buildings and complexes were sprouting up all the time. The art, shopping, and nature districts were incomparable to anything I&#39;d seen in the US midwest. The history and culture is also fascinating; I was surprised to learn that 29% of South Koreans identify as Christian (after talking to a couple of them, though, a very different flavor than what I was used to). I visited many incredible landmarks with fascinating stories. And there is no other establishment in the world like to a Korean jjimjilbang.</p>
        <p>Overall, I loved my time there. After a couple weeks of being enamored, though, you start noticing a lot of troubling things. Mass public drinking into the morning is definitely fun, but it starts to get disturbing around 2pm, when you see too many people in business suits passed out on the street, littered with bottles of soju. I had a strange encounter with a man on the street, who seemed very confused, and didn&#39;t know what to make of it; it was only later I learned he was developmentally disabled, and he had been abandoned by his family. Eventually, you get a sense for this kind of sheer hollowness and superficiality that permeates Korean culture. Beauty and presentation standards there are ridiculously high, with something between 20% and 50% of young Korean women undergoing some kind of plastic surgery (most commonly, they have <em>aegyo-sal,</em> a small cosmetic operation done on your eyes). There is a surprising obsession with Western status symbols; the shopping districts are littered with places like <em>Paris Baguette</em>, which seem primarily there to show off to others how cool and Western they are. The overall fascination with Western appropriation just makes you feel a little unsettled (in stark contrast to Taiwan, which seemed much more whole and comfortable with their own culture and way of life).</p>
        <p>The most gutturally distressing thing I encountered there was talking with young Korean students. Korean students spend almost their entire waking lives studying. To illustrate, I just picked this account randomly off of Quora;</p>
        <p><em>How many hours does the average South Korean student study per day?</em></p>
        <p><em>Depends on the student. My daughter rises up at 7:46… hopefully. She goes to school, ends at 3:00 or 4:00, depending on the day. Then it&#39;s hag-won ( <strong>학원</strong> ) time; 5–10 is the norm. Back home around 10:30. Rests a bit, and studies at least until midnight (I drop down then.. so I wouldn&#39;t know if she keeps on studying). Sometimes she&#39;s studying around 2 or 3 am. Weekends.. hag-won for 4–5 hours. The rest of the time you study or relax, depends.</em></p>
        <p><em>Oops.. she&#39;s middle school.</em></p>
        <p>I had a couple of friends who were English teachers, and they invited me to a reunion dinner with a group of their former students. It seemed like there was an incredible amount of trauma and sadness in their faces when talking about the school system. One particular girl, who stood out as one of the few bright voices, was a brilliant speaker and leader; she was dedicated to getting out of the country as soon as possible, wanting to study diplomacy in Europe.</p>
        <p>Mark Manson put it best; &quot;<a href="https://markmanson.net/5-life-lessons-5-years-traveling-world">the best part of a country or culture is also usually the worst</a>&quot;. To summarize, at least in my experience, there are good and bad things about every culture and group of people. Perhaps I emphasize traveling too much, this kind of understanding is essential in the practice of <em>tolerance</em>. This doesn&#39;t mean liking, supporting, or even recommending a particular way of life; it just means being able to get along with them well enough to not disturb each other, and work together on common interests when the need arises.</p>
        <p>Tolerance is best mediated through rational, civil discourse. Diverse groups of people need to be able to come to some kind of understanding with each other, and the best way to do that is talking about it. Sometimes, talking is not enough, and disputes can only be resolved through more primitive forms of power struggle; such is life. But there&#39;s a basic playbook of practicing tolerance that every good citizen should be acquainted with: First <em>understanding</em>, then <em>communicating</em>, and then, when only absolutely necessary, <em>fighting</em>.</p>
        <p>One thing to note is that that tolerance seems to get universally harder to maintain as you get older. As you become set in your ways, you inevitably start to lose understanding and empathy with people vastly different from you. Their mistakes and cruelties just become too predictable, too avoidable. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s actually any way to get around this; I think young people are just always going to have an advantage here, and is one reason why their perspective is so desperately needed in the civic process.</p>
        <p><strong>Humble.</strong> Ah, humility. It&#39;s crucial to be humble. I have almost nothing interesting to say here. It&#39;s a boring acknowledgment that the scope of things outside your control are infinitely larger than the very few things you have control over. Failure to be humble means that the world is going to kick your ass until you learn how to be humble. And that&#39;s that.</p>
        <p> I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s any direct path to humility. Time inevitably makes you humble, and you just learn to live with it. It&#39;s one advantage that old people squarely have on younger people. Just try to remind yourself that you&#39;re not that cool, you&#39;re not that smart, you&#39;re definitely not powerful, and nobody cares about you and your stupid opinions. It&#39;s gonna suck when your body starts to give out on you. And no matter how hopeful things are, or how hard you work, things can and will always get far worse than you can possibly imagine. So try your best to be humble.</p>
        <p><strong>Respect for the rule of law.</strong> This one is a doozy, and one where my own position is the least certain. I can only triangulate between my thoughts expressed in part 1 and part 2 of this series.</p>
        <p>The core concept to consider here is justice. Historically, our ideas of justice are actually rooted in an Anglo-Saxon tradition of government, wherein the right to rule is neither hereditary, nor divinely ordained, but rather derived from the ability of sovereigns to execute the delivery of justice to the best of their ability. I will spare you the butchering of history here; there is plenty to read about if you google some phrase like <em>Anglo-saxon rule of law justice legitimacy</em>, or some variation.</p>
        <p>The American evolution of this idea is simple; the principles of the American revolution have been drilled into us by grade school. Law is meant to protect the people, and if it fails to do so, it is the duty of the people to resist or change that law.</p>
        <p>There are a few versions of this; in the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson wrote:</p>
        <p><em>...whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government...</em></p>
        <p>I very much enjoy Martin Luther King Jr&#39;s later rendition, which is more familiar to us:</p>
        <p><em>One has not only a legal but a moral responsibility to obey just laws. Conversely, one has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws.</em></p>
        <p>I won&#39;t elaborate on our current criminal justice system; suffice to say, I think it sucks super hard. Regarding the BLM movement, my opinions are as follows: Police killing of innocent people is bad. The cradle-to-prison pipeline is mostly real. And wanton violence and destruction is also bad. None of these views contradict each other, but trying to hold any position publicly with any sort of nuance is a maddening experience in our hyper-polarized discourse, since any position not clearly identifiable within party lines becomes immediately suspect.</p>
        <p>My problems articulating what should be done in regards to BLM is my core motivation for writing this series. It ended up taking almost 20,000 words to articulate my thoughts clearly. If I want to summarize my entire thoughts on the subject to young people who want to make progress in regards to the brutal murders we&#39;ve witnessed, I offer the following:</p>
        <p><em> <strong>Young people need to take civics seriously</strong>. They need to</em> <em> <strong>practice the qualities of civil discourse with intensity,</strong> </em> <em>and ultimately they should</em> <em> <strong>engage older people to develop acceptable solutions and policy,</strong> </em> <em>taking decisive action to address the serious underlying structural problems without resorting to a pre-packaged ideology that a majority of the country will simply not accept. This is the only way to be effective at achieving your goals within the confines of our democratic system.</em></p>
        <p><strong>Effective.</strong> I&#39;m going to get even harsher on young progressive people here. A great TV show called <em>Yes, Prime Minister</em> illustrated this beautiful symbolism called the &quot;politician&#39;s fallacy&quot; that encapsulates the thought process of a great number of people confronting a serious issue for the first time. It goes like this:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>We must do something</li>
        <li>This is something</li>
        <li>Therefore, we must do this</li>
        </ol>
        <p>At worst, this type of thinking represents a form of extreme laziness. It&#39;s usually a manifestation of a primarily emotional response to challenging events, and is a failure to separate an internal instict from higher-order reasoning capabilities.</p>
        <p> The first step is good; <em>we must do something</em>. But here people predictably trip up at the fallacy of the excluded middle; we need to take a long pause when we get to <em>this is something</em>, and we need to spend a very long time exploring, elaborating, and debating on the thousands of potential <em>somethings</em> we should consider to address the problem in a lasting, satisfactory way.</p>
        <p>A particular refrain I&#39;ve heard way too much over the last month goes something like this, broken into its logical components:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Some police are committing atrocities (<em>we must do something)</em></li>
        <li>We could abolish the police (<em>this is something)</em></li>
        <li>We must abolish the police (<em>we must do this)</em></li>
        </ol>
        <p>There is actually a tried-and-true process when it comes to the art of being effective, which also has three steps that must happen <strong>in order</strong>: 1) Identify the problem, 2) Discuss potential solutions, 3) Decide on a solution and implement it. In too many cases, this process is garbled up into a political ball of mud that amounts to a tantrum; &quot;This thing is bad! Make the bad thing go away!&quot;. A good citizen should strive to do better.</p>
        <p>(Note carefully; I&#39;m not making the case that we shouldn&#39;t abolish the police! Maybe a combination of national guard + social service would do much better. Maybe disbanding current police departments and reforming them works. I&#39;m truly not an expert here, but the thought process behind many claims to &quot;abolish the police&quot; are as clear as day).</p>
        <p>Another ineffective avenue of young progressive activism is that people seem to be obsessed with <em>taking first steps</em>, and being content with purely symbolic victories. Jon Stewart had a great quote about this from his recent appearance on the Joe Rogan podcast:</p>
        <p><em>This shit isn&#39;t gonna be fixed by HBO Max pulling Gone with the Wind; [...] we&#39;re still at the symbolic stage. We&#39;re still doing this shit that is symbolic. And this is where leadership becomes such a crucial component; so you have this great awakening of energy. It has to be channeled into something lasting and meaningful; we have to diagnose the real problem underlying this moment, so that we don&#39;t make a mistake in just changing the window dressing, and the gilding, on the buildings.</em></p>
        <p><em>This has to be foundational, in a way that will create something lasting. And that&#39;s the hard part.</em></p>
        <p>You need to think hard about the issue at hand, you need to think deeply about the history of the problem (and various solutions that have already been tried), you need to consider the first-, second-, and third-order consequences of your policy, and you need to acknowledge how the perceptions of your policy will be received by fellow citizens. Ultimately, you need to <strong>collaborate</strong> with everyone else (both those that agree with you and those that don&#39;t) to come up with a plan of action -- and yes, maybe even a compromise -- that fulfills your own goals while keeping everyone else happy.</p>
        <p>Otherwise, your action is extremely likely to do more harm than good. When you don&#39;t think through your speech very carefully, the usual consequence is that not only is your platform not implemented, but the blowback from the other side actually hurts your cause. It&#39;s not even just that the hated outgroup is just going to hate you even more; the more unreasonable and uncivil you are in your activism, the more you <em>actively recruit</em> otherwise neutral or young people to the &quot;enemy&quot; team. It is not an exaggeration at all to say that the primary reason Donald Trump got elected is a protracted effort of complete disregard for the conservative point of view in media, academia, and public opinion. Over decades, this marginalization built up an intense rage, which has spilled out into all the problems we&#39;re having today, even to the detriment of the very movement that got Trump elected in the first place.</p>
        <p>To summarize: If you&#39;re aiming to take any political action, you need to be very careful that your message is as effective and uncontroversial as possible. Then, when you&#39;re ready, you need to have the courage to execute on it.</p>
        <p><strong>Service.</strong> Not only <em>should</em> you do something about the things you care about, you <em>must</em> do something, as part of your duty as a citizen. If you have taken care of everything else in your life, if you are stable, happy, productive, and have free time; if your community and family are in good shape; then, you must serve others. If you find that you actually have hope for your country, and want to contribute positively to it, then you must serve your country.</p>
        <p>I feel incredibly weird saying this out loud. There&#39;s a weird association with the phrase <em>serving your country</em> that associates you with some specific set of old, parochial, bigoted, conservative beliefs. I&#39;m not saying you need to go join the army, abandon your values, or do anything of that sort; I&#39;m saying the complete opposite. If you are strong and have excess energy / attention, you should do whatever you can in your power to make your environment a better place to live, for yourself and for future generations.</p>
        <p>I should strongly emphasize that, until you are ready to be a good citizen, you have no special duty to go out of your way from the process of your own development. Even after you officially turn 18, you may still have a lot of growth and self-exploration to do before you can give back and contribute in a significant positive way. In this case, the best thing you can do to serve your country is to focus on yourself.</p>
        <p>This is also weird for me to say because, I, too, am right in the middle of the process of that transition. Up until the last year or so, I was entirely uninterested in any kind of &quot;positive contribution&quot; to the world, to the US, or even to my local community. Because the US political situation has devolved into such a complete turdhole, many of my very brilliant, respectable, and kind friends have completely disengaged from any hope of improving things here in America, and I can&#39;t say that I blame them. Putting a bunch of effort into contributing to a fundamentally lost cause is just a pointless waste of time. If I had one thing to say to them, it would be: Maybe it&#39;s time to start engaging again.</p>
        <p>And, as stated, I&#39;m still not 100% sure myself whether America, or democracy, or liberalism are lost causes or not. I don&#39;t think any of us actually know that. But I do know that, <em>in principle</em>, if something like our experiment is to work, then it will require service and self-sacrifice on the part of everybody to make it happen.</p>
        <p>==</p>
        <p>Obviously, this list is not exhaustive. This is quite a large topic, and while I can&#39;t go on forever, these are the qualities I believe to be most important. Where you should be at different points in your life is not a science, and I am not anything close to an authority on what any specific individual to do. But hopefully, I&#39;ve outlined some good areas to think about.</p>
        <p>With a rough theory of <em>what makes a good citizen</em> in place, the next question then becomes: <em>How do we make good citizens</em>?</p>
        <p> There is a chicken-and-egg problem here; good citizens have to exist, which form good institutions, which then make good citizens. The simplest way to improve our current citizenry is to identify good people who already exist, to listen to them, and to follow their recommendations.</p>
        <p>It might be helpful to split democratic subjects into two categories: <strong>followers</strong> and <strong>leaders.</strong> Everyone is born a baby, and babies by default are not good citizens; they are <em>followers</em>, who are led by their parents.</p>
        <p>Sometimes parents are not good leaders; in this case, they ought to be <em>followers</em> themselves of other good parents. Sometimes, children exhibit uncanny aptitude and wisdom; they could act as <em>leaders</em> of other children, and if they are unfortunate enough to lack adequate guardians, they should form their own path (ideally, supported by the state, charities, or by other families).</p>
        <p>Both followers and leaders follow the same essential path of citizenship, the work of becoming better is never done in this regard. Some people might be born with many advantages, or have a natural inclination toward leadership. Some people are fundamentally uninterested in leadership, and will remain as followers their entire life. It&#39;s very important that we don&#39;t consider these categories immutable; every person has the capacity for both, in different dimensions, at different points in their life (except perhaps edge cases like early infancy, advanced age, or temporary hardship).</p>
        <p>The most common case, of course, is that people will be leaders in some aspects, and followers in others. Personally, there are a great many things I don&#39;t know about; I&#39;m terrible at science, math, medicine, and academics of any kind, really. I know almost nothing about econometrics, trade deals, engineering, or food production. The list is endless. What I do in those cases is that I try to find perspectives of people who seem like they know what they&#39;re talking about, and I advocate lightly for the solutions they propose.</p>
        <p>Notice, I don&#39;t use the word &quot;expert&quot;; it&#39;s disturbingly common to get a PhD in some field and be completely disconnected from reality. What I look for is people who have such a mastery of a topic they&#39;re able to summarize and explain their viewpoints to laypeople. This is why <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36GT2zI8lVA">Richard Feynman</a> is considered one of the greatest public scientists; he embodies the principle of communicating his advanced knowledge in the simplest terms he can. These are the people whose ideas I truly respect, and the people who are worth listening to. Signal boosting some public figure because they have a fancy credential, when you yourself don&#39;t understand the argument they&#39;re trying to make, is counter-productive.</p>
        <p>A good touchpoint on this is the subject of identity. As a white person, I know almost nothing of the experience of being black in America. I do my best to find and boost black voices whose messages resonate with me (most recently; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tR6mKcBbT4">Dave Chapelle</a>, <a href="https://www.city-journal.org/reflections-on-race-riots-and-police">Coleman Hughes</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSORAAcgP18">Open Mike Eagle</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/@doncalloway/george-breonna-ahmaud-the-american-myth-c73ace470245">Don Calloway</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSWasOhArfM">Killer Mike</a>), but it&#39;s not my place to pretend like I know everything, or try to be an &quot;expert&quot; on black experience. There are also many black voices that just aren&#39;t very valuable to me; they&#39;re either saying things I&#39;ve already heard before, or they seem uninterested in achieving any kind of unity or consensus (which is completely understandable! generational trauma due to centuries of oppression will absolutely crush this in people, which itself is a major part of the problem… cf <a href="https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a23960/james-baldwin-cool-it/">James Baldwin</a>, Malcolm X, MLKJ, and many others).</p>
        <p>The muddy algorithm we use, tossed into an imperfect world, is first to identify and boost the voices of good leaders. There are a great many strong, wise, thoughtful, and courageous people in our country. I take most of my cues from them. The Internet is a huge boon here; the practice of <em>minding your social graph</em> is central to this, which we explored in Part 2.</p>
        <p>The second thing required is deep introspection: Right now, in what areas could you be a leader, and in what areas should you defer to others? If you have something to contribute, what specific avenues can you pursue to reach people? Should you help individuals directly, or should you extend your reach by creating media that expresses your viewpoint? Do you even have bandwidth to do so, or are there pressing issues in your life that require your attention first?</p>
        <p>If you&#39;re not currently in a position to provide leadership, which existing leaders do you want to boost -- and how can you help them? What qualities can you improve on, to make yourself stronger, and thus have free energy to guide others? (If you&#39;re like most people, you likely need more money / employment freedom somehow). Which people do you think are clearly bad leaders, that other people should stop listening to? (Maybe a little bit of cancelling is healthy).</p>
        <p>==</p>
        <p>The leader/follower dichotomy is perhaps a good short-term answer to <em>what can we do now</em>. Over the longer term, the thing to focus on to cement societal strength is building and maintaining good <em>institutions</em>.</p>
        <p>It&#39;s no secret that many of America&#39;s institutions are broken. Whether you look at health care, or the education system, or financial organizations, NGOs, wherever; there are myriad problems abound that have a large part to play in our current civilizational strife. Many of these problems we already know about, and are discussed in the political world at length. But what most of these conversations miss is both the sheer <em>scale</em> of the failures at play, and the particular risks that arise when multiple institutions face lethal strain (or even collapse) simultaneously. As the easiest example, the institution of journalism has been thoroughly hollowed out and delegitimized, primarily due to the new economics of digital publication and advertising (recalling the outrage-attention-monetization loop we discussed earlier). Media is a lynchpin for all sorts of other systems in a democracy; if the people are not adequately and fairly informed about the state of other cogs in the machine, voters remain blind to important issues that should grab their attention.</p>
        <p>The definition of what is considered an &quot;institution&quot; is quite vague; I mostly think of them as lasting organizations with very long-term goals of maintaining and improving the shifting values and needs that underpin a nation&#39;s survival and flourishing. The civilizational scholar Samo Burja has some good elucidation on the topic <a href="http://samoburja.com/institutional-failure-as-surprise/">here</a> and <a href="http://samoburja.com/functional-institutions-are-the-exception/">here</a>. Here&#39;s a short list of what I consider critically broken institutions that, over the long run, we should strive to find adequate replacements or reforms for:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Family is an institution.</li>
        <li>Health care is an institution.</li>
        <li>Primary and secondary education are institutions.</li>
        <li>Research and academia are institutions.</li>
        <li>Media is an institution.</li>
        <li>Charities and NGOs are institutions.</li>
        <li>Government bureaucracy is an institution. <em>[what do we do with orphans?]</em></li>
        <li>Internet infrastructure is an institution.</li>
        <li>Law is an institution.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Why have all these institutions let us down? I actually don&#39;t have many good answers for what specifically went wrong in these various areas, but I give some brief thoughts about why institutions fail in the general case.</p>
        <ol>
        <li><p>Maybe institutions just fail over time. They just inevitably get deteriorated by some ineffable force; Gresham&#39;s law, or cronyism, or power grabbing, or goodheart&#39;s law, or the complacency of elites, or simple gravity wears them down. In this view, there&#39;s nothing we can do about it; all societies are doomed to just crash at some point, as the systems underpinning civic functioning give out due to old age. The best we can do is weather the storm, muddle through a small dark age, and live to fight another day.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>Technology changes things too rapidly for institutions to handle. As stated, the best way to maintain or change any highly complex system is to move very slowly. When you can&#39;t predict exactly what&#39;s going to happen if you attempt to make some drastic change, the best things you can do are 1) implement small, piecemeal reforms to improve the most visibly broken parts that people complain about, or 2) try to keep everything else steady as you try making some kind of big overhaul. In recent memory, presidential tenures have one or two big changes they try to make (in Bush&#39;s case, it was Medicare expansion and No Child Left Behind; in Obama&#39;s case, it was the Affordable Care Act). These types of overhauls have a history of not going so well.</p>
        <p>Technology is the opposite; it moves extremely rapidly. When Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn introduced packet switching in 1973, the speed of development in networking communication expanded so rapidly that it quickly outpaced our legal system, our banking system, our media system, and then eventually our ability to even comprehend what was happening at all. Similar recent developments in artificial intelligence and genetic engineering have the capacity to cause a similar disorientation. There&#39;s no clear answers about what to do about this; science and technology played such a huge role in the dominance of the West historically that it would be very hard at this point to convince people that maybe we should slow things down a bit while we integrate all of these new developments into culture and law. China, for one, certainly doesn&#39;t seem interested in slowing down...</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>Changes in the geopolitical landscape also have a huge hand to play in the destabilization of otherwise functioning political entities. Here&#39;s where a rough understanding of the 20th century really comes into play. There is a clear narrative between America&#39;s involvement with the league of nations and WW1, to the inevitable build up to WW2, to our immediate actions against the USSR in the cold war, and then to where we ended up in the post-cold-war period. I focus on the cold war a lot, because while we technically &quot;won&quot; the immediate conflict vs global communism, the 1980s were really when we cemented in a particular set of ideologies and ways of living that directly paved the way for all of the problems we&#39;re experiencing today. Particularly, the philosophy of big business capitalism took a deep root in how we measure and think about the health and flourishing of our people.</p></li>
        <li><p>Finally, institutions fail because they get corrupted by bad philosophy. This is my favorite explanation, but it&#39;s very weird to think about. Isn&#39;t philosophy something a bunch of nerds a long time ago cared about, but we pretty much don&#39;t need any more? I can&#39;t really give a clear definition of what I call philosophy, but my short definition is that it&#39;s the art of coordinating abstract thinking with producing elementary goodness in the real world. I take philosophy very seriously, and I think more people should as well. A handful of good philosophers, defining and clarifying terms, identifying levers of action, and expanding on and interpreting fundamental questions and paradoxes in reference to the specific challenges of our modern environment would do America a lot of good. This essay series itself is a philosophical work, centered around the idea of civics.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <p>So, to summarize; if we want democracy to work, we need better citizens. For citizens to get better, we need to do some deep introspection, and follow the thoughtful voices with good ideas on how to mitigate our immediate problems. And then finally, we need to have better institutions, which will help make better citizens.</p>
        <p>==</p>
        <p>With all of this in mind, we should end on a sober note. Let&#39;s start trying to make democracy work. But we face real challenges, and it is very important to consider that they may, in fact, be insurmountable. Out of all systems of government, modern democracy is still new, it&#39;s still unproven, and it continues to lose ground at an alarming pace.</p>
        <p>Some form of centralized control -- perhaps not totalitarianism, but maybe some form of constitutional oligarchy -- might lay in our future. It behooves us to consider these alternatives to democracy with a straight face. Smartypants neoreaction people should lay out a practical plan for how we could transition peacefully (a very popular starting point is <a href="https://www.unqualified-reservations.org/2008/11/patchwork-positive-vision-part-1/">Patchwork</a>, if you&#39;re interested). Then, we should compare and debate the merits and problems of those approaches against the enormous cost of what I&#39;m arguing for, which is in the realm of <em>societal transformation</em>.</p>
        <p> I truly do not know if this approach is workable; there are plenty of examples in history where campaigns of massive societal transformation caused a huge amount of trauma and pain (the main example that pops to mind is Mao&#39;s cultural revolution). I don&#39;t think that civic transformation necessarily has to be as frantic or painful as it has been in its worst instances. But big changes are always fraught with hard challenges and risks, and it&#39;s hard to predict anything when the scale and complexity of the topic defies mortal comprehension.</p>
        <p>I still think there is hope. We have two superpowers that no other nation in history has in the realm of civil governance; we have <em>the internet</em>, and we have <em>cheap world travel</em> (Well, before the virus hit, at least). These inventions are so new that I think they should be given time to work, before we scrap the constitution and go with some novel approach featuring cryptographically ensured robot armies. But that&#39;s just my opinion; I actually don&#39;t know anything.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, it&#39;s up to all of us.</p>
        <p>Happy 4th of July.</p>

        <p><strong>Wed Jun 24</strong></p>
        <p>The New York Times is writing a piece about Scott Alexander, a highly influential pseudoanonymous blogger in the broader internet smartie community. In the article, they plan to reveal his real name (to &quot;doxx&quot; him). In response, Scott Alexander has deleted his blog, replacing it with a plea to remove his name from the article. Much furor among internet smarties has ensued.</p>
        <p>Scott Alexander is a terrific thinker, writer, and educator. He is easily one of the smartest, kindest, and most articulate voices we have in contemporary America. From his meta-analyses of complex scientific topics, to his deep and thorough reviews of important books, to his exquisite craftsmanship of political philosophy metaphors, he has been a positive influence on a great number of people, including myself and many of my friends. His blog, Slate Star Codex, is a national treasure. He is one of my <a href="https://cjohnson.io/#writing">favorite writers</a>, and I owe a good deal of my own writing inspiration and style to reading several books&#39; worth of SSC posts.</p>
        <p>I was outraged when I heard the news. I strongly like Scott Alexander and I strongly dislike the New York Times; SA provides incalculable value through his writing and ideas, and NYT is actively hostile and harmful toward civic democracy. In frank personal terms, I want a network of Slate Star Codex-like blogs to become the &quot;newspaper of record&quot;, and I want NYT to go out of business, resigned to the dustbin of history. Furthermore, SA has some proximity to my small social graph; as a friend-of-a-friend, I feel compelled to &quot;have his back&quot;, regardless of circumstance.</p>
        <p>After being torn up about it for a couple of hours, though, I noticed that I'm actually conflicted about something here. After interrogating my feelings, I realize the situation is not exactly clear-cut. In the spirit of the rationalist community itself, I&#39;d like to explore an outside view of #SSCGate, mostly to clarify my own confusion about it.</p>
        <p>[Note; I am not, myself, a rationalist, and I actually don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea to play devil&#39;s advocate just &quot;for the sake of argument&quot;, especially when someone in your broader community is under direct personal threat. My position regarding Scott Alexander is simple; the NYT should cave, they should not print his name, and then they should go out of business. But the issues at play here are important in the broad discussion of civics in a society with free speech norms, so let&#39;s talk about them.]</p>
        <p>It&#39;s worth starting with an acknowledgement that this is a momentous event for the internet smartie community; serious bloggers of any stripe should now think very carefully about what they write or publish online, even under conditions of semi-anonymity. The chilling effect here is significantly harmful to American civil discourse, and this potentially signals the end of an era, which I deeply, deeply lament. Perhaps this article is a short ode to a culture that raised me when I had little other guidance for my intellectual growth.</p>
        <p>There is a <strong>strong</strong> anti-doxxing norm when writing on the Internet. For decades, the world wide web was a secure place for controversial thinkers and writers to explore pure ideas, share information, and collaborate on useful projects. A lot of that has changed in the last decade. The 2010s saw the rise of <em>cancel culture</em>: The practice of dedicated, angry cultural writers scouring every word a public figure has ever written, in order to pin them down to some unsavory political affiliation. Notably, this practice was pioneered by the tabloid magazine Gawker; may it rest in pieces.</p>
        <p>There are several reasons why internet writers prefer to be anonymous. There&#39;s a circulated <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=3376">blog post</a> about a prolific Russian mathematician named Andrey Kolmogorov, who lived and worked under several generations of Soviet dictatorship, including Stalin&#39;s regime. Obviously, being a sensitive and thoughtful person in the heyday of the USSR is, let&#39;s just say, a unique challenge. He shares my views on <a href="https://cjohnson.io/#time-to-grow-up"><em>shutting the fuck up</em></a>:</p>
        <p><em>Every mathematician believes that he is ahead of the others. The reason none state this belief in public is because they are intelligent people.</em></p>
        <p>Kolmogorov&#39;s strategy was a perfect fit for the country and the time he lived in. It&#39;s a good position for all thinkers to consider; broadly applicable in a wide variety of situations. My central argument here, however, is that <em>Kolmogorivism is not a silver bullet approach to speech actions in all situations across time and space.</em> For the last decade or two, the wise move for intelligent people in the Western world was to always pick <em>exit</em> and/or <em>loyalty</em> in Hirschman triumvirate of political action. It&#39;s worth considering that <em>cancel culture</em> in America may be coming to an end; it&#39;s possible that <em>voice</em> is now a legitimate option in the 2020s. If true, this would be a good thing, and it would behoove internet folk to reevaluate their hardened position on anonymity.</p>
        <p>==</p>
        <p>The first missing piece in the <em>doxxing bad</em> argument is an exploration of the multiple interlocking risk factors that drive writers to remain incognito. I can count at least six:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Annoying unwanted attention -- paparazzi, fans you have to deal with</li>
        <li>Dangerous unwanted attention -- crazy people stalking you, threatening you and your loved ones</li>
        <li><em>Cancel culture</em> -- a specific confluence of cultural, political, and technological forces in the 2010s which wrought great havoc on Western society</li>
        <li>Professional risk -- competing roles and priorities when one holds a specific set of jobs</li>
        <li>Challenging cultural power directly -- pissing off <em>the wrong person</em>, a la court drama</li>
        <li>Challenging state power directly -- direct calls for violent revolution and such</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Let&#39;s start with attention. A small amount of private attention, from people you care about, is awesome. A large amount of public attention, from people you don&#39;t know, sucks. It sucks to be famous, or even semi-famous. You can&#39;t walk into a cafe and buy a latte without random people walking up to you and saying, &quot;Whoa! Are you such-and-such? I loved your thing!&quot;. If you&#39;re lucky, you quickly say &quot;thanks&quot;, sign an autograph, and move on. Mostly, this is just a minor distraction. But it can balloon into real problems; paparazzi exist, and as you get more famous, your private behaviors become increasingly scrutinized, which can quickly become a major nuisance that prohibits your freedom. I hate paparazzi; I think they are terrible, their actions should be illegal, I feel deeply for people burdened with them, and I wouldn&#39;t wish them on my worst enemy.</p>
        <p>Fame itself can have other consequences; it can be disastrous for forming new relationships, and it can impact existing ones. It&#39;s hard to consider somebody as a real person when they don a mantle of &quot;highly respected authority on such-and-such&quot;. From what I understand, this can make one feel very lonely, and feeling lonely is bad.</p>
        <p>Secondly, attention can become dangerous. If your work is interesting enough, you can attract legitimately crazy people into your orbit. Affectionately known as <em>stans</em> (from the Eminem song), these people stalk you, consume every work you&#39;ve produced, fantasize that they&#39;re in a personal relationship with you, and the truly crazy among them actually do, in some instances, take actions to cause you harm. Typically, you want to avoid this outcome.</p>
        <p>Those are very rare cases, though. Most stans are generally harmless, and although they can be a nuisance, can also be a boon. Everyone has stanned someone at some point or another; it&#39;s a normal part of life. I&#39;ve definitely stanned a couple of people over the years. Overall, though, the asymmetric nature of the relationship can be scary and worrying, and has the potential to make things shitty for you.</p>
        <p>Attention can also attract <em>haters</em>. There&#39;s some kind of core human dynamic where people just have an irrational hate for other people who are popular. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s some good evolutionary reason for this. There is some kind of rhyming pattern between <em>haters</em> and <em>stans</em>; <em>haters</em> will also stalk you, read everything you've ever wrote, and become obsessed with you. Scott Alexander, against all odds, has a good number of haters; as an artist, there's pretty much nothing you can do about them. Summa summarum; attention can attract <em>haters</em>, and haters are bad.</p>

        <p>Now let&#39;s talk about <em>cancel culture</em>. Cancel culture can refer to many things, and there are many explanations of it. Generally, it refers to a pattern of &quot;investigative journalism&quot;, wherein a highly dedicated person or group sniffs out a public figure as being &quot;suspicious&quot;, and then proceeds to do PHD-level research on every utterance, action, and affiliation ever attributed to that person, in order to publicly prove that the figure is either thoroughly terrible and reprehensible, or that person is acting as a clandestine operator for some great, malign, world-historical force, like <em>literal naziism</em>. Usually, the prescription is to utterly destroy that person, either by getting them fired, or ensuring through dedicated PR campaigns that person never holds any position of authority or respect publicly for the rest of their lives. Cancel culture, in my opinion, sucks.</p>
        <p>Cancel culture itself is usually attributed to some other great, malign, world-historical force, like <em>cultural marxism.</em> I consider it much more banal; in descriptive terms, it was a unique, brief period in American history characterized by three forces:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><em>The internet / social media</em>, which both 1) vastly the expanded the recording and transmission of individual utterances from a person, sometimes decades old, from which to mine evidence that the person holds reprehensible views and affiliations, and 2) bred a strange and awful set of incentives to produce the maximum amount of outrage among audiences, in order to drive page views, in order to drive ad revenue. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE3j_RHkqJc">This video</a> is a good explanation of the dynamics; long-time SSC readers will know that Scott himself first touched on this phenomenon with his <em>Toxoplasma of Rage</em> post.</li>
        <li><em>Cultural progressive ascendancy</em>. I&#39;ll summarize this briefly; in the 1960s, a new wave of progressivism took hold in the Western world, known as the "civil rights era". In the 1980s (the "Reagan years"), cultural conservatism bounced back, emphasizing traditional family values. In the 2000s, the pendulum swung back toward civil rights, this time focusing on economic injustice and police brutality. It happened to time perfectly with the rise of social media; if internet technology became widespread in the late 1970s, I have no doubt that social media would have been wielded by &quot;moral majority&quot; types to similar levels of harm.</li>
        <li><em>Foreign policy</em>. There&#39;s elementary reasons that political forces in the US support the progressive ideology; it&#39;s good for geopolitical business. The USA has benefited immensely, over <em>centuries</em>, from its worldwide branding as a mostly equal place that people from any background, ethnicity, or religion could come to and make a life for themselves and their families. <strong>This is a super good thing</strong>, and regardless of your opinions on the domestic &quot;culture war&quot;, it would strongly behoove every American to deeply understand and continue to propagate this legacy.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The specific combination of these three elements produced a uniquely terrible time for everybody, especially for sensitive intellectuals. Understood separately, they seem relatively tractable and benign, but together, they caused much pain and trauma that still sends ripple effects through media and intellectual spaces.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, I think this period is over. In my estimation, the heyday of cancelling is long past; it was mostly prominent for about five years, approximately between 2012 and 2017:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>2010 was roughly the year social media took off in the broader public, and was the first time people could really start scouring and collecting large amounts of &quot;ammo&quot; against people they didn&#39;t like. The outrage-clickbait-monetization loop seemed to start kicking in a couple years later, but I'm not sure about the exact timeline (Kony 2012 is the first instance I remember). Hopefully somebody is writing a definitive history about this.</li>
        <li>Trump&#39;s election in November 2016 signalled the beginning of the end of this pattern of incivility. His presidency did two things: First, It soaked up almost all of the attention and energy of would-be cancellers. Secondly, his movement created a market of cultural arbitrage; if you&#39;re a media figure that got &quot;cancelled&quot; in the mainstream-progressive sphere, there&#39;s now a secondary &quot;omg i got cancelled unfairly&quot; market you can pull an audience from. Many people still seem unaware of this secondary market, or are otherwise unwilling to participate in it, but it&#39;s growing by the month, and you are no longer completely SoL if you are targeted by some kind of outrage mob.</li>
        <li>It&#39;s worth noting there are still many people, maybe 2%-3% of the population, that are still stuck in spheres dominated by the <em>cancelling</em> mentality. Mostly; pockets of effusive liberalism in a couple coastal cities, the world of academia, and the entertainment industry. As the &quot;secondary market&quot; continues to grow more robust, it is increasingly upon individuals to exit those spaces still terrorized by fervent adherents to the &quot;everyone I don&#39;t like is a nazi who must be destroyed&quot; praxis.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Next on, we have <em>professional risk</em>. This is something that is related to cancel culture, but is actually more universal, and extends outside of it. In a nutshell, if you are a prominent leader within a company or institution, your public speech and actions outside of the scope of that organization actually do affect the organization. PR will always exist. If you do things outside of work that people don&#39;t like, and it causes consequences for your primary work, <em>you are responsible</em> for those consequences, and the organization should act accordingly. Cancel culture being dead doesn&#39;t change that (in fact, a briefer description of cancel culture is just <em>PR risk on steroids</em>).</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, this type of professional risk is especially prominent for certain types of jobs, like being a psychiatrist, or being a church leader. There&#39;s lots of precedent and discussion for how &quot;free speech&quot; norms pretty much go out the window in these situations. For a legal view, you can look at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson_Amendment">Johnson Amendment</a>, but this has been a longstanding debate in American politics, with lots to read about it on both sides. I won&#39;t get into it here, but if you practice one of these sensitive vocations, you have <em>extra extra</em> responsibility to be careful about making public waves.</p>
        <p>The last two categories are the hardest to define. They essentially revolve around <em>pissing off people in power</em>. They&#39;re worth talking about together, because throughout most of history, they essentially meant the same thing. In non-constitutional systems of government, like absolute monarchies, or autocracies, <em>the court</em> and <em>state power</em> were the same entity. Being a cultural dissident was <em>literally</em> a challenge to state authority. If you made a personal enemy of someone in high places, you would fear for the life of yourself and your family. The circumstance of pissing them off doesn&#39;t matter; anything from heartfelt public speech with noble intentions, to accidentally sneezing on someone&#39;s food at a dinner party, could be punishable by anything from complete social ostracization to swift execution. In Kolmogorov&#39;s time, this was obviously the case, and he was right to keep his mouth shut for the entirety of his life.</p>
        <p>I&#39;m happy to report one thing, with tears in my eyes, as I salute the nearest flag; we do, in fact, live in America. And America is actually a much better place than Soviet Russia, or Victorian England, or 95% of various political orders throughout history. No matter how much its values seem to have have degraded in recent years, the fundamentals of speech and punishment in the US have not actually changed much. We have a strong constitution, strong norms around the first amendment, strong rule of law and due process, strong separation of civil and criminal disputes, and a healthy culture of criticizing elected leaders to the harshest extent we like. I can say things like &quot;Ted Cruz is a giant crybaby poo-poo butt&quot; with essentially no fear for my personal life.</p>
        <p>But let&#39;s get dicey for a second. There&#39;s a case to be made that there are more &quot;powerful&quot; people than elected officials, whom, if criticized, are less subject to standard protections of free speech, due process, etc. I would be much more worried, for example, of saying something like &quot;Ezra Klein is a total dipshit&quot;. It&#39;s likely that, if he read this post, he could easily order one of his minions to execute a <em>cancel culture</em>-style mission on me, doing obsessive research to try to destroy my life, completely outside of the purview of the legal system. I don&#39;t think I&#39;d like to risk something like that. So, therefore, uh, Ezra Klein is, uh, probably a fine guy, I guess, I&#39;ve never met him, so I can&#39;t judge him, so, like, yeah. But it&#39;s worth noting that it&#39;s still possible in America to piss off people with <em>cultural</em> power, and they do have the reach and capability to make your life awful. So even if your family isn&#39;t in danger of physical harm from the Stasi, it&#39;s still wise to avoid making enemies of people in high places.</p>
        <p>Finally, there are speech actions that are legally, morally, and practically prohibited. You cannot incite terrorism or call seriously for violent overthrow the government. Basically, just don&#39;t do that.</p>
        <p>==</p>
        <p>So, we&#39;ve outlined some reasons why noble people who have something good to say should try to remain anonymous. I think they are good reasons, and we should encourage having distinct forums where people can speak anonymously without fear of reprisal.</p>
        <p>The case of Scott Alexander is good for everybody to think about; even beyond the particulars of his professional predicament, we should discuss some general principles for when thoughtful people should in fact <em>not</em> remain an anonymous, faceless voice.</p>
        <p>As stated, my view is that the New York Times should not doxx Scott Alexander. There are elementary reasons for this; first, the NYT&#39;s policy on doxxing is not consistent. They have published many accounts, profiles, and viewpoints of people who have wished to remain anonymous, up to and including every article containing the phrase &quot;<em>people familiar with the matter&quot;</em> and &quot;<em>sources close to so-and-so authority&quot;</em>. Their stated &quot;policy&quot; that they &quot;never&quot; respect a subject&#39;s wishes for anonymity is frankly dogshit.</p>
        <p>For my second point, I will refer back to the internet&#39;s strongly enforced norms regarding doxxing. At least until recently, the Internet had its own, unique, shared cultural norms around expression. And violating someone&#39;s identity preference is probably the strongest shared norm in this culture. This goes, like, way back, is a very important and positive norm, and we should try to retain at least some forum where anonymous voices can be heard.</p>
        <p>My third point is that Scott is just, like, a great guy, man. Leave him alone.</p>
        <p>There&#39;s probably a concept in jurisprudence, where, when norms and laws regarding a particular case have yet to be fully formed, the particular defendant should be found <em>not guilty</em>, but at the same time, the case should establish a precedent that the prevailing norms going forward should be changed. In this case, we should find Scott <em>not guilty</em>, but we should think about three points regarding how cases like this should be treated in the future.</p>
        <p>Harkening back to my <a href="https://cjohnson.io/#writing">earlier thoughts</a>, writing as an art has two relevant properties: Humans are <em>highly susceptible</em> to the written word (young minds in particular), and that writing is a <em>double-edged sword</em>, capable of causing harm and good to the reader in equal measure. It doesn&#39;t matter how noble or careful you are; if you&#39;re an excellent writer, and you publish your work broadly, you will necessarily garner influence over a great number of people and affairs. And, as the saying goes; with great power comes great responsibility.</p>
        <p>It&#39;s kind of a weird concept in our free speech-loving culture to think of writers wielding a large amount of responsibility. Typically, if a work of art causes someone distress or anxiety, it is seen as the consumer of that art&#39;s fault. I find this weird, abnormal, and I&#39;m not sure what to think about it. But if one&#39;s position is &quot;I&#39;m just putting ideas out there; if someone uses them wrong, that&#39;s on them&quot;, I&#39;m not sure I totally agree with this at a gut level. I don&#39;t have much more to say about this; it&#39;s is a huge, society-spanning question, that&#39;s beyond both my pay grade and the scope of this post. But ultimately, Scott should have <em>some responsibility</em> for the things he writes, and anonymity could potentially be used improperly, as a shield against this responsibility.</p>
        <p>Secondly, Scott&#39;s job as a psychiatrist. This one is a really tough call, but I feel like my own personal opinion on this one is clear: When you take a position as any kind of mental caretaker over other humans, you forgo certain rights to become an influential public figure in your spare time. This should apply to church leaders, school officials, counselors, psychiatrists, etc. This is a harsh rule, and one that I will have to think about more. I just think it&#39;s bad for society to mix particular vocations and public advocacy in weird ways like this. Again -- I think it would be unnecessarily cruel to strip Scott of his career at this point, given the aforementioned strong cultural norms on the internet of even-freer-than-usual-speech. Going forward, I assume Scott is already thinking about which is more important to him; I strongly hope that <strong>he</strong> gets to make that choice, and not an unelected board of wayward cultural authorities.</p>
        <p>The last has to do with civic duty, specifically referencing Hirschman&#39;s concept of <em>voice</em> as a political action. At a certain point, it is your <em>duty</em> as a citizen to speak up, publicly, about critical issues that affect the entire nation. I think refusing to do so, even at substantial personal cost, could be considered a regrettable form of cowardice. For the record, <em>I am not saying Scott Alexander is a coward;</em> I am speaking in general terms, for others who practice Kolmogorov complicity without considering their own role and responsibility in shaping our collective future. I do suspect that the collective failure of intelligent voices to use <em>voice</em> over the last decade or two has contributed, at least in small part, to the substantial degradation of our public sphere. There is an alternate universe where perhaps <em>cancel culture</em> could have been stopped in its tracks, if enough influential people had stood up and condemned it during its worst years.</p>
        <p>Finally, if you do choose to use your voice publicly, I do think you should be held <em>accountable</em> for your speech. That means knowing who you are, what you do, where you come from, what you represent, etc. To use a cheap example, there are absolutely foreign operators working within the US to influence public opinion this way or another, sometimes to the detriment of the US. If all significant voices remain anonymous, it will be impossible to piece out whether an opinion represents a truly American-interested perspective, or is just harmful noise propagated by faceless agitators.</p>
        <p>There is a tension here with my views on <em>cancel culture</em>, which, as stated, I think sucks hard. I haven&#39;t thought this through entirely, and might just be one of those fundamental paradoxes that everyone has to wrestle with forever. My feeling right now is something like: People ought to know basic things about you (who you are, where you&#39;ve been), but scouring a person&#39;s entire corpus of utterances for perceived cultural infractions is way over the line. There&#39;s some kind of balance here, and it&#39;s something that will have to be constantly negotiated in every culture and polity with strong free speech norms.</p>
        <p>My final word on this: If you have considered all the above, and still wish to remain anonymous, you should take it seriously; use cryptographically ensured masking protocols, only communicate through secure channels, and consider publishing on digital platforms that understand and respect your particular sensitive needs.</p>
        <p>Thank you for reading; I thank Scott Alexander deeply for his work and wish him the best.</p>

        <p><strong>Sat Jun 20</strong></p>
        <p>&quot;<em>It's time to grow up; a brief introduction to civics in the 21st century&quot;</em></p>
        <p>America is in a state of crisis. It's actually worse than that; we're facing a crisis within a crisis within a crisis within a crisis. How many layers of crisis are we even on? The future mocks us -- <em>you are like little baby; watch this</em>.</p>
        <p>This essay will be bombastic and provocative. It will convince few. Those who would benefit from the words here are least likely to heed it. But I'm worried; and either I&#39;m worried too much, or other people aren&#39;t worried enough. Writing it down will allow me to clarify my thoughts and clear my own head.</p>
        <p>``` Disclaimer: People who know me are aware that I often worry way too much about widespread catastrophe, and so far I have always been wrong. So if this essay makes you worried, consider that I just rubbed off on you a bit; talk to friends, relatives, and trustworthy sources to confirm or deny the validity of specific anxieties. Many smarter and wiser people than me do not seem as worried. If you&#39;re already anxious or fearful about the state of America, or you are not in a headspace now to receive information that can potentially hurt you, this essay will not help; please close the tab, you can come back at any time.</p>
        <p>I write in a style that is particularly dense, takes lots of detours, and touches on a very wide range of topics and emotions, which can be hard to read if you&#39;re exposed to too many new ideas at once. I might be too overcautious about this, but I&#39;m particularly sensitive to it. Remember the golden first rule of the Internet: You can always turn it off. ```</p>
        <p>This essay is addressed to young people. I&#39;m 29 and I grew up with the Internet. There are two groups of scarily unreasonable political blocs in the United States; aging boomercons and radical young people. Since I think the former group is utterly impervious to any form of persuasion, and I am a member of the latter group, I am addressing them.</p>
        <p>Americans born after 1980 were raised in a very peculiar environment compared to the world average; the later stages of the <em>pax americana</em>. We have no collective experience or memory of hunger, strife, widespread violence, or true civil decline. Everything has been vastly safe and easy compared to life in other places and times. The closest we&#39;ve come to serious national calamity are 9/11 and the 2008 crash. We are like little baby.</p>
        <p>9/11 was notable almost primarily for it&#39;s normalcy. A terrible, tragic event that changed the shape of America; the patriot act was signed, we got entangled in the middle east, and it ushered the beginning of the end of -- if not the American empire itself -- the spirit and ideology of &quot;spreading global democracy&quot; that propelled it forward.</p>
        <p>It was also <em>not that bad for almost all Americans</em>. Except for new yorkers directly affected by it, and servicemembers who fought and died afterward, a vast majority of us made it through the event essentially unscathed. Three properties saved us from mental and material turmoil: 1) A general wave of prosperity in the 90s propelled by our victory over the USSR and cheap oil, 2) We had an immediate clear sense of a direct external threat to which our anger and vengeance could be directed, and 3), we were unified collectively around this purpose (We were fine with Afghanistan, it wasn&#39;t until the Iraq war two years later that serious divisions started).</p>
        <p>The 2008 crash was also bad. Many families, homeowners, and businesses were devastated financially by the housing crash; a good number have still not recovered. But we were saved by the magic of bailouts and printing money, at only the cheap long-term cost of torpedoing the legitimacy of institutional capitalism over which we fought the cold war in the first place. A vast apparatus of systemic corruption expanded from the top, and the pretense of principled fairness and economic justice vanished in the eyes of serious observers. The now-vestigial praxis of neoliberalism -- less an ideology than a duct-tape set of &quot;go brr&quot; heuristics -- took hold, with the central message and rallying principle of <em>just keep the system running</em> that we begrudgingly accepted for the time being.</p>
        <p>In 2020, we have entered act three of the post-cold-war era. This is the most dire situation we&#39;ve seen ourselves in since at least 1973 (but still probably less dire than 1941). A quick recap of where we&#39;re at:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>40 million+ unemployed</li>
        <li>Deadly virus at 100k and counting death toll</li>
        <li>Riots and protests we&#39;ve not seen since the 60s</li>
        <li>A divisive and incorrigible President uninterested in acknowledging or fixing anything</li>
        <li>A new great power rival eating our lunch in almost every department of political and cultural competition</li>
        <li>Cumulative long-term philosophical damages from 9/11 surveillance state and 2008 widespread corruption</li>
        <li>A broken education system, a broken healthcare system, a broken vast bureaucratic administration, broken corporations, and broken hearts and spirits everywhere.</li>
        <li>An entire media apparatus completely bankrupt of both journalistic integrity and public authority</li>
        <li>A supply chain held partially hostage by aforementioned great power rival</li>
        <li>A cratering of civilian trust in law enforcement authorities and the criminal justice system.</li>
        <li>A citizenry that is almost completely oblivious to the scale of these various problems.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I could go on and on. The scope and complexity of the issues facing American civil society today are beyond comprehension. But don&#39;t hold your breath; it gets far worse.</p>
        <p>The last bullet point is perhaps most important. I would say a majority of young Americans are grossly ignorant to the breadth of problems threatening a lethal breakdown of the American republic. In addition, few ruminate on how these issues compound each other, or from a historical sense, how thin the veneer of civilization is. <em>The Collapse of Complex Societies</em> is an academic view by Joseph Tainter in the 80s which defines <em>collapse</em> as &quot;a rapid, significant loss of an established level of sociopolitical complexity.&quot; (Jared Diamond published a coffee table version in 2004; I have no idea if it&#39;s any good). For a more visceral view, consider <a href="https://aelkus.github.io/void/2020/06/01/opening?fbclid=IwAR2AX4O2W0mMCp6zTAArOvrPdTJLu7eW5_XOK8RebIxQoOVXIaMbknOgPDU">this</a> recent piece by Adam Elkus:</p>
        <p><em>The weakest constraints of all are social constraints. Without norms, conventions, and institutions, humans would constantly need to evaluate their surroundings to get a sense of what their neighbors are doing prior to selecting actions. When these structures constrain behavior, humans</em> <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/learning-to-be-thoughtless-social-norms-and-individual-computation/"><em>can be</em></a> <em>&quot;thoughtless.&quot; We do not think, we simply do. Because it is the way things have always been done, and we do not need to think about it. We can take things for granted, and project out stable patterns for the duration of our lives. Social constraints flatten, canalize, and domesticate human behavior, and they are what largely make &quot;social science&quot; possible. The social scientist searches for stable regularities to document, but everyday citizens depend on them to go about life without worry.</em></p>
        <p><em>When social constraints are weakened, the aggregate predictability of human behavior diminishes. Why? The weakening of constraints generates</em> <a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674018433"><em>confusion</em></a><em>. Things have always worked until they suddenly break. Things have always been decided for you until you have to suddenly decide on your own. Another way of thinking about social constraints – with a very long history in social science – posits them as involuntarily assigned expectations about the future. Prolonged and severe disruption of expectations without immediate prospect of relief accordingly should create greater variance in potential outcomes. The simplest way to understand the omni-crisis is as the sustained breaking of expectations and disruption of the ability to simulate the future forward using assumed constraints.</em></p>
        <p>==</p>
        <p>None of this is anybody in particular&#39;s fault -- it sure as hell isn&#39;t the fault of us young people. But it is here, it is now, and it is overdue for us to reckon with.</p>
        <p>The main reason people remain oblivious to systemic problems is that we&#39;re, like, pretty busy with stuff, man. We have jobs, relationships, hobbies, and other patterns of living and coping with the world that we must (and should) sustain. Keeping a job in particular is highly stressful; we&#39;re excusedly pressed out of concern for big picture issues because if we fail to continue the <em>get money, pay rent, and eat food</em> cycle, we&#39;ll be pretty SoL and won&#39;t know what to do next. I, for one, should be doing work for my job instead of writing this essay.</p>
        <p>I&#39;d like to forward the proposition that we might just be SoL anyway.</p>
        <p>As children of the <em>pax americana,</em> food, clothing, and medicine exist like air to us; summonable by performing the ritual of <em>job</em> -- if that fails, to the invocation of <em>asking our parents for help</em> -- if they won&#39;t help, we beg charitable institutions -- or, finally, we can always turn to the welfare state. Very few of us know how to make electricity, how central heating/cooling works, anything about the vast chain of international business partnerships that procure clothes for us, or how hard it is to grow a stable crop on a homestead.</p>
        <p>Identifying important issues and informing people to take civic action is supposed to be the job of the media. Well. I won&#39;t get into this here. Matt Taibbi has a <a href="https://taibbi.substack.com/p/the-news-media-is-destroying-itself">good write-up</a> of the current state of &quot;leftist&quot; outlets. &quot;Rightist&quot; outlets remain far worse. And of course, nobody ever reads &quot;neutral&quot; outlets (How can you remain neutral on a moving train? What spineless nerds they must be). Suffice to say that News has been Fake for as long as I can remember, and it will provide no solace here.</p>
        <p>Underlying the long-since-decayed corpse of journalism is a pervading mode of cynicism toward democracy among our elites. Earlier I referred to this as &quot;go brr neoliberalism&quot; -- Just keep everything running, don&#39;t bother with public opinion, and avoid spiking anxieties as much as humanly possible. This has been the default modus operandi of elite philosophy at least since I was born, in 1991.</p>
        <p>It might have actually worked; it might have actually been the good thing to do. But it didn&#39;t work. It failed. I would say our anxieties are pretty fucking spiked right now.</p>
        <p>==</p>
        <p>So, where are we at? As of today, things are still &quot;mostly okay&quot;; we&#39;re not yet considering <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfZcKCIcug8">eating our neighbors</a>. Societal order and rule of law have taken a vicious bruising, but still have not totally disintegrated. The zombie apocalypse is still far off.</p>
        <p>The truth is, the above problems are just the tip of the iceberg. On our current trajectory, and with the intractable polarization that has taken root at the heart of the American soul, things can potentially get far, far worse.</p>
        <p>It&#39;s impossible to predict what could or might happen, but here&#39;s a short list of possibilities:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Breakdown of food supply chains</li>
        <li>Global dumping of US treasury bonds / mass devaluation of USD</li>
        <li>Further violent chaos instigated by crazy or malicious agitators</li>
        <li>Deterioration of civil-military relations</li>
        <li>Crumbling of our literal democratic mechanisms; people don&#39;t trust voting anymore</li>
        <li>A devastating cybersecurity attack targeting the power grid, the internet, or other critical infrastructure</li>
        <li>Hardliners getting tired of all this shit and implementing actual facism</li>
        <li>Some other unforeseen catastrophic event, like a natural disaster</li>
        <li>A shooting war with China or Russia</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It&#39;s almost not even worth considering exactly how, why, or when further breakdowns will occur. The likeliest crucial moment will be in November, when unity degrades to the point where nobody trusts the voting system (In Soviet America, politicians vote <em>you</em>!). And we&#39;re not yet ready to talk about <em>what can we do about it</em>. This essay will be long and incomplete.</p>
        <p>For what it&#39;s worth, there are brilliant hardworking men and women across the country who have dedicated their lives to preventing such apocalyptic shatterings of American civility; servicemembers, bureaucrats, and leaders representing the core of our nation&#39;s enduring charter. There are a great many neutral and good-hearted people working tirelessly to protect us, themselves, and the American way of life, and I give sincere thanks to them as often as I can.</p>
        <p>But; they are almost exclusively older people, at least over the age of 35. And even they are straining. They have protected us and shielded us from the terrible, horrible, no good, very bad, thankless labor of managing the intricacies of problems in the real world. And sometime in the future -- perhaps sooner than we are ready -- that burden will fall to us. Who, I have to say, thus far seem both unprepared and uninterested in the job.</p>
        <p>And don&#39;t get me wrong; I&#39;m not immune to this in the slightest. I&#39;m only writing this because I want the system to <em>go brr</em> again so I can get back to playing videogames, watching anime, and hitting on cute girls at bars. Dealing with reality is necessary and noble when it presents you with non-ignorable challenges, but it should not be valorized or canonized into &quot;everyone has to be maximally real and terrified at all times&quot;. Fuck that. When we get through this shaky transition, we&#39;re gonna have robots that make us food; we&#39;re gonna have automated, accountable security systems; we might even achieve a system true digital democratic representation. I&#39;m very excited to see that world for us and our children.</p>
        <p>To summarize: <strong>America has problems, and they are deeper and more real than the problems you think it has. And soon they will not be abstract problems on your computer screen; they will come to your doorstep, you will be forced to confront them, and they will be the ultimate problems of our collective survival.</strong></p>
        <p>==</p>
        <p>So, let&#39;s talk about the last three weeks. It&#39;s been a tough year for America, and so far June has been the toughest. Things seem to have calmed down a little bit; narratively, it feels like we&#39;re taking a bit of a <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeachEpisode">beach episode</a> to cool off in the middle of a plot-heavy season. This is much needed; the amount of fear, anger, sadness we&#39;ve experienced has been considerable, and I&#39;m glad we&#39;re able to pause for a breather and some reflection before things kick off again (hopefully, developments will wait until we approach November).</p>
        <p>To get you back in the mood, let&#39;s watch this video together. This will be challenging; as the Youtube warning says, viewer discretion is advised. If you think you get the gist, you can stop whenever; the video doesn&#39;t contain much new information.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3n5_D59lSjc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3n5_D59lSjc</a></p>
        <p>If you have a heart, it is very hard to watch this. It doesn&#39;t matter what your politics are. If you feel &quot;triggered&quot; by it, you are having a normal and healthy response shared by many people (if it doesn&#39;t affect you at all, there might actually be something wrong with you).</p>
        <p>I want to avoid picking this apart politically as much as possible, but here are a few things I observed:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Tucker Carlson is widely popular and speaking to a very large audience who support him, trust him, and watch his show regularly. His show has an average of 4.6 million viewers. It&#39;s hard to find demographic data, but I am guessing they skew older, conservative, white, poor, and politically radical.</li>
        <li>Most of the audience likely has not seen the 100s of videos of excruciatingly brutal police tactics circulating on Twitter; of violent attacks on peaceful protestors, of shooting and arresting journalists, and accosting and arresting random citizens not even taking part in protests. They likely don&#39;t know that stuff even exists.</li>
        <li>He is engaging in clear, purposeful race-baiting throughout the segment.</li>
        <li>I personally find this video to be abhorrent, disgusting, and irresponsibly divisive at the worst time in American history to be engaging in such reckless bullshit.</li>
        <li>I&#39;m speculating, but it seems that Tucker thinks of the current situation in America as a mere political problem; he uses the tragedies occurring primarily to target prominent political leaders in both parties that he doesn&#39;t like, and he recorded this video because he believes it will drive people to vote for candidates he likes in November.</li>
        <li>It&#39;s almost certain that the stories, interviews, and videos he provides of violence and chaos are factual and authentic; virtually no other outlets were covering the carnage to any comparable degree in terms of comprehensiveness and forcefulness of Tucker&#39;s polemic.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I don&#39;t really want to keep talking about Tucker Carlson. I don&#39;t think he matters that much. But his audience and message is real; it&#39;s not going away any time soon.</p>
        <p>For what it&#39;s worth, his audience are American citizens; many of them are kind to their families and neighbors. This is the group I referred to as &quot;aging boomercons&quot; in the opening paragraphs, a group I can safely say is categorized by bitterness and meanness in the public sphere, but also a group that has been suffering in their own way for a long time. For practical purposes, they seem immune to reason.</p>
        <p>I worry about this group, but I don&#39;t have anything to offer on how to persuade them, help them, or interact with them in any way. I&#39;m <em>not</em> worried about violent right-wing militias or terrorist groups; if they violate the rule of law, nobody will shed a tear when they are put down, and they understand this very well. The best thing to do is vote them and their representatives completely out of serious policy considerations.</p>
        <p>What I <em>am</em> worried about is this:</p>
        <p><a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1267129644228247552">https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1267129644228247552</a></p>
        <p>As with everything our President says on Twitter, this should be taken with a quarry&#39;s worth of salt. He tweets stupid ridiculous shit all the time that has nothing to do with anything. Nobody knows what &quot;Antifa&quot; is, or what &quot;designate as Terrorist&quot; would entail, or what being &quot;designated as a Terrorist&quot; means in terms of national security or law enforcement.</p>
        <p>The simplest meaning is that the President is making a vague threat to use the vast surveillance state to combat violent left-wing militias or terrorist groups as he defines it. As President, he is able to do this.</p>
        <p>At least, he thinks he is able to do this.</p>
        <p>Enter Four-star General James Mattis; a widely celebrated military officer, all around spectacular human being, and probably the closest thing we have to a war hero. On June 3, he penned a letter published in <em>The Atlantic</em> strongly denouncing our President&#39;s actions and rhetoric. It&#39;s unprecedented in American history for a retired general to criticize a sitting commander-in-chief in such a direct way. In addition, it&#39;s one of the coolest fucking things I&#39;ve ever read:</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/06/james-mattis-denounces-trump-protests-militarization/612640/">https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/06/james-mattis-denounces-trump-protests-militarization/612640/</a></p>
        <p>It&#39;s hard to add any commentary here; plus, my arms are busy, involuntarily saluting the nearest American flag.</p>
        <p>When I read this, for about 15 minutes I was worried that some kind of coup was taking place. Upon reflection, reading some more perspectives, practicing self-care, and otherwise calming the fuck down, I&#39;m no longer worried about this.</p>
        <p>For starters, other members of active duty military leadership seem to be on board with the whole &quot;not doing civil war thing&quot;:</p>
        <p><a href="https://twitter.com/BillKristol/status/1268324463550107651">https://twitter.com/BillKristol/status/1268324463550107651</a></p>
        <p>In addition, it&#39;s actually pretty reckless and stupid for civilians to comment or speculate on civil-military affairs; the Mattis piece may have been a significant political move, but things at this level move far slower and steadier than any of the media-staged slap fights we&#39;re used to. There are actual adults in charge here, and I have faith in them.</p>
        <p><a href="https://twitter.com/marty_lederman/status/1268368925265408001">https://twitter.com/marty_lederman/status/1268368925265408001</a></p>
        <p>Finally, there are civilians, reporters, and historians who do pay attention to this kind of stuff. There&#39;s precedent for everything in history, and if you&#39;re still concerned, there are perspectives out there you can dig up to add sensemaking and context when &quot;real&quot; shit happens beyond your experience or comprehension.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2020/06/not-civil-military-crisis/165946/">https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2020/06/not-civil-military-crisis/165946/</a></p>

        <p>So; on top of impeachment, the ridiculous third-grade ego of our President, and the worst level of polarization in our country in many decades -- Suffice to say, we&#39;re facing a serious political crisis. I won&#39;t even comment on Congress, cabinet officials, or the vast government bureaucracy; they all suck total monkey balls.</p>
        <p>The next big area of concern is the economy. I actually studied Economics in college, and I&#39;ll be the first to tell you that most of it is over-wrought academic mumbo-jumbo. What ultimately matters is that the <em>job-money-rent-food</em> cycle continues &quot;working&quot; for most* citizens. Very serious threats like hyperinflation, devaluation of currency, or mass defaults of households and businesses are now on the horizon. When James Carville said &quot;it&#39;s the economy, stupid&quot;, he was referring to this; if most* people cannot sustain their livelihoods through the economic system, and order cannot be kept through the judicial / military system, that&#39;s when the zombie apocalypse starts. Nobody wants the zombie apocalypse to start.</p>
        <p>By the way; The * and scare quotes around &quot;works&quot; is meant to be comical; one critical issue that young people <em>have</em> largely kept on is how broken this system is for the bottom 20% (the &quot;precarious class&quot;), who have been barely scraping by for decades. It&#39;s a big source of all of these problems, but it&#39;s about to be a bigger source of bigger problems when the precarious class percentage creeps up to 30%, 40%, 50%...</p>
        <p>I don&#39;t even have to mention the whole &quot;pandemic killing people by the hundreds of thousands thing&quot;. By the way, there&#39;s a pandemic killing people by the hundreds of thousands. As bold as it sounds, I honestly think this is the least of our concerns. I have nothing unique to contribute, because young people already know what to do: Test, trace, clean things, social distance, and wait it out.</p>
        <p>I could go on and on; this is just a taste. I don&#39;t want to spend the rest of this essay belaboring the idea that <em>things are really bad</em>; hopefully you&#39;ve gotten the point. If you want to scare yourself more, here&#39;s a smattering of more reading I&#39;ve collected over the last couple of weeks; knock yourself out. I haven&#39;t even read most of these; at this point I just glaze over URLs with words like &quot;democracy die 150 days&quot; and &quot;banks careening implosion&quot; and throw it into my &quot;use this shit in my essay about how bad things are&quot; collection.</p>

        </ul>
        <p>In short: Things are bad, they could get worse, they&#39;re mostly fine now, and young people need to start doing something.</p>
        <p>==</p>
        <p>[Intermission; now's a good time to pause, grab some water, go for a walk, etc. The rest of the essay is an abrupt change of tone and content. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxtmQDCyLE8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxtmQDCyLE8</a>]
        <p>==</p>
        <p>So, what do we do?</p>
        <p>My short answer is: Nothing.</p>
        <p>There&#39;s nothing to do because nothing <em>can</em> be done. Three short reasons:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>The elites keep you distracted and this is probably good</li>
        <li>Few of us are in a state to contribute positively without causing harm</li>
        <li>You cannot improve things personally and coordination is impossible</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As stated, there is a concerted effort, grounded in cynicism, to remove the American public from critical decision making. As it stands, I share this cynicism. It&#39;s hard to try and put it into reasonable words. Instead, I&#39;ll copy-paste an excerpt from my personal journal I wrote some time ago to try and articulate my feelings on seeking accurate and useful information in today&#39;s world:</p>
        <p><em>Everyone everywhere is so fucking unbelievably, incacluably, catastrophically stupid, so utterly devoid of critical thinking ability that it has boggled my mind in and out of sanity several times throughout my adult life, everything you read or hear or see on TV is a fucking advertisement or marketing ploy so shallow that the only response of reasoning human beings is a perpetual state of vomiting out this absolute garbage that we are constantly being assaulted with from every direction in every layer of media, academia, and discourse, and there is no hope anywhere ever of finding any truly neutral or good set of facts or analysis to make sense of what's going on so just completely give up trying and become a total intellectual hermit</em></p>
        <p>So uhh… yeah. I uh. Let&#39;s just say that I, too, am rather cynical.</p>
        <p>I&#39;ve spent far too much of my life trying to wrestle with the question of how to get young people to think more critically. This is something I think the adults are squarely responsible for. All I remember from my childhood is grown-ups saying &quot;Think Critically! Think Critically!&quot; over and over again. I heard something somewhere that we&#39;re supposed to have this thing called &quot;school&quot; that has something to do with this, but the details are vague and I&#39;ve concluded that the myth of &quot;schools&quot; existing are mostly just apocryphal fairy tales.</p>
        <p>Unwinding yourself from pushed narratives is a very long, very arduous, and very fruitful process. Everyone has to kind of figure it out themselves as they become an independently thinking adult. Probably most people are not capable or interested in doing this, and that is probably okay. And everything is so polarized in The Discourse that even signifying yourself as an independent thinker is scary, dangerous, and ill-advised; if I were to list a single public figure I thought was stupid, exactly ½ of people would tag me as a dangerous propagandist from the enemy team, and the other ½ would tag me as a brave ally just speaking my mind for the good team. (Okay, fine, I&#39;ll give you two: John Oliver and Ben Shapiro are mind-bogglingly stupid).</p>
        <p>==</p>
        <p>I can&#39;t teach you how to think for yourself. But I can share some things that have helped me.</p>
        <p>The first is isolating yourself from everything. There&#39;s a whoahh-zen contradiction here I&#39;d like you to take seriously; you should be more aware of things, but first you have to be less aware of things. For about 1.5 years I read zero things; no opinion columns, no analysis, no news, nothing. Everything just <em>went brr</em> and I could focus on my job, relationships, and general happiness. For my intellectual growth, it was the best period of my life.</p>
        <p>That&#39;s the second thing; focus on your health. It&#39;s not just detaching from media that&#39;s important, you also have to build up goodness in yourself. Get a therapist, see a doctor, share your feelings and worries with friends and family (if you can), read the bible and pray (if you're into that), get good exercise, eat better, whatever. I won&#39;t belabor the self-help stuff, other than noting that it&#39;s more important than ever, and that self-care is, in every situation, always the first and most important concern.</p>
        <p>Improving yourself is really the first step to improving things around you. The strength of ourselves, our families, and our communities comprise the total strength of America as a nation. So the most helpful thing you can do is focus on that.</p>
        <p>Many people are already decently healthy. Many of them already avoid &quot;the news&quot; or people with obvious agendas. How do you go about finding neutral, intelligent, and trustworthy accounts about the happenings of the outside world?</p>
        <p>One superpower our generation has is the Internet. It was way better for finding this sort of stuff back in the 00s, but if you scrounge around you can still find some honest, articulate people with insightful perspectives. [Note: it has deteriorated much in the last decade. The reasons for this are manifold; I&#39;ve got my eyes on you, FAANG].</p>
        <p>One insight about finding good writing on the Internet is minding your <em>social graph</em> -- the web of connections and relationships in our society. If you read something that resonates with you, find out what that author reads and who they trust, and then read those things too. I stumbled onto a couple blogs back in 2013, and have been blessed with enough free time to build out a small social graph around them, through which I&#39;ve talked to and met several interesting people (a few of which became lifelong personal friends). If you don&#39;t have enough free time, that&#39;s totally okay; it's 100% recommended to focus on your immediate problems before exploring new ideas.</p>
        <p>Lastly, try to read sources that write with minimal emotion, bias, and calls to direct action. There are many well-written things out there that are purposefully attempting to manipulate you into buying a product, joining a team, or otherwise subverting your own personal thinking. It&#39;s not the worst thing to get persuaded by something you truly believe in, but just try to be careful.</p>
        <p>==</p>
        <p>So if you&#39;re a healthy and independent thinker, what&#39;s the next step? Still, nothing. Our most ancient instinct is, when confronted with harrowing collective problems, to stand up on a tree stump and say: &quot;These problems are terrible! We must do something about them! Who&#39;s with me?&quot;</p>
        <p>No, you must certainly not. If you follow through with this, you&#39;ve already failed. You cannot &quot;build a movement&quot;, you cannot write a manifesto, you cannot rally people to your cause. You will achieve nothing, you will likely cause more harm than good, and you will fail; not just in your cause, but in your life.</p>
        <p>It took a good portion of years to wean myself off of this instinct. Luckily, I always failed even before the first step began; every time I tried to write a manifesto, it just sucked too bad. I&#39;m beyond grateful and blessed that I never finished one, because the next steps in &quot;movement-building&quot; are harder, shittier, and confer far more disastrous consequences.</p>
        <p>To even begin, you need to be completely dedicated to it. You&#39;ll need to start with an abundance of time, attention, money, resources, good health, and strong connections. You need to be an exceptional person: ideally, you rolled 18s at birth on str, dex, con, int, wis, and cha. These requirements cut essentially every effort off right from the get-go; no matter how strongly you feel or how good you think your ideas are, you probably just don&#39;t have what it takes.</p>
        <p>Of course, it gets way harder. The first step is to develop a clear, hardened philosophy, and then be able to articulate it and defend it repeatedly across diverse modes of communication. This will take a large amount of time, and you will need to read a wide swath of history and perspectives to fortify your thoughts.</p>
        <p>Then, you need to manage relationships, both within the boundaries of your &quot;movement&quot; and the world at large. This is a hard task for every person, and there are no shortcuts or hacks, especially if you want quality people in your movement who are also able to think for themselves, manage their own relationships, and build out their own ideas. Depending on the scale you want to achieve, this part of the process will take roughly an infinite amount of time.</p>
        <p>If you can accomplish this at even very small scales, you&#39;re on the right path. The next big problem is that you <em>degrade yourself</em>. When you&#39;re fully engaged in pursuing some purpose or mission, you&#39;re spending all your attention and energy on philosophy, relationships, and resources. You become pretty much unable to take in new information and exert flexibility with changing circumstances. Furthermore, getting the group to change with you is very hard; it requires a lot of trust and loyalty, which, again, take a lot of time, which is always dwindling away.</p>
        <p>The people who manage to succeed at building a medium-scale movement or audience typically become shallow caricatures of themselves. They have some initial success, people adore them, and then a positive feedback loop forms, and they become addicted to the widespread positive attention their public personas provide. In short, you become a John Oliver or a Ben Shapiro. You may be able to influence a lot people for a short time, but since technology / economics / politics changes so rapidly in our era (thanks, Internet!), the horizon of your &quot;movement&quot; producing good value -- before becoming a zombified husk that mostly holds back progress -- is shorter than ever.</p>
        <p>Lastly, there do exist such things as ordinary, cliche power dynamics, a la <em>Game of Thrones</em>. There are existing structures of power; there are &quot;elites&quot;, and while they mostly ignore young people writing emotional screeds on social media, they do pay attention when a serious, organized movement starts to form.</p>
        <p>I&#39;m going to leave these concepts of &quot;power&quot; and &quot;elites&quot; as horrendously ill-defined. You can read more history or watch <em>Peaky Blinders</em>, but I&#39;m pretty sure we all have our own vague ideas about how we think this works, because if there&#39;s one thing our generation excels at, it&#39;s watching HBO.</p>
        <p>So like, the federal government exists. It has an army, a vast surveillance network, a judicial system, et cetera. You may have valid concerns with it; and while we still have free speech in this country (U-S-A!, U-S-A!), it is a set of organizations that you should <em>respect</em>. For my part, I&#39;ll be a little contrarian here and say that the federal government consists mostly of the aforementioned good, hardworking, and older people working diligently to keep us safe and preserve -- in their eyes -- &quot;our way of life&quot;. Personally, I greatly enjoy the fruits of living in a mostly* secure and prosperous society, I wish to continue enjoying those fruits, and I would like to spend my life caring about more interesting and beautiful things than the gritty realities of statecraft.</p>
        <p>I&#39;ll make a small note for the truly radical and passionate among you who are pulled into fanciful ideas about how much power you have, and desire to directly challenge &quot;the system&quot; by engaging in radical, violent behavior, by challenging the rule of law directly, or by otherwise thinking they have the wherewithal or capacity to try and overthrow local or federal governments. The only thing I have to say regarding this is, like, hahahaha, go watch some documentaries on Waco or something, noob.</p>
        <p>==</p>
        <p>I apologize if this essay so far has been too long-winded; I do actually have a point to get to. So let's get to what I'd actually like to write about: A brief introduction to <em>civics</em>.</p>
        <p>A quick recap:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Things are bad</li>
        <li>Things could get worse</li>
        <li>There are good adults working hard to protect you; listen to and respect them</li>
        <li>There&#39;s nothing you can do</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As I see it, there are two effective modes of action about how to proceed.</p>
        <p>The first is participating in the democratic system: Go out and vote.</p>
        <p>Young people just suck at voting. I&#39;ll confess something myself: I&#39;ve never voted in my life, and I&#39;m not sure I regret it.</p>
        <p>There&#39;s a pernicious feedback loop at play regarding youth participation in the American electoral system. Since young people don&#39;t vote, political parties organize themselves around catering to old people. So, nobody bothers appealing to young people. So, young people don&#39;t vote. Sooner or later, you find yourself in an aging gerontocracy, facing cascading systemic crises, led by confused seniors that barely know how to send an email; you get <em>Joe Biden</em>.</p>

        <p>Joe Biden sucks. Donald Trump, as stated, sucks. Who out there in the political arena could possibly save us?</p>

        <p>The young people have spoken, and they have answer: What if we had a President who was.........<em>even older</em>?</p>

        <p>So. Um. thank you for staying with me thus far, young person in America. I appreciate your time and openness. I&#39;m now going to confront you directly. The hard truth is that Bernie Sanders, while a good person and noble activist, is an unrealistic choice for leader for our country.</p>

        <p>Bernie Sanders is a movement-builder. He has fought long and hard his entire life for the causes he believes in. They&#39;re good causes that I mostly support. But he has long-since caricatured himself; he has not incorporated any significant new information or changed his perspective on key issues since the 1970s. It&#39;s not his fault; this is pretty much inevitable for every public figure. He deserves to stay around in politics and media as a prominent voice for the disaffected.</p>
        <p>But he would not make a good President. Unfortunately, the aging boomercons are 100% right on this one: You cannot simply wish for everything you want to happen instantaneously for free without having to put in any hard work or considering the system as a whole. Sorry, friend. It is time for us to actually grow up.</p>

        <p>Young people should participate in politics. We should go out and vote. But the top three candidates presented to us in this election cycle are just duper super shitty. I won&#39;t dissuade you from voting; it&#39;s a good thing to do, and 2020 might be the first year I actually do it. But it&#39;s still not my preferred mode of action.</p>

        <p>==</p>

        <p>My preferred mode of action is, for lack of a better term, ordinary community building. The rest of this article will just be filled with cliches.</p>
        <p>Community-building is movement-building&#39;s much prettier cousin. Do everything listed in the above section on movements, but without any particular purpose, platform or goal in mind. Improve yourself, build relationships, live your life, make money, and <em>pay vastly much more attention to your local environment</em>.</p>
        <p>There is so much going on around you, wherever you live; everything is more interesting, beautiful, and rewarding than anything you see or read about on the Internet. Trust me, I&#39;ve been an internet addict since the age of 11. I&#39;m still glued to Twitter sometimes. But the more I can pull myself away, the happier, healthier, stronger, and more able to take focused action I become.</p>
        <p>Go figure out who owns your local corner store; find out where they&#39;re from, what they&#39;re passionate about, and what their pets&#39; names are. Learn the history of various buildings and districts in your area. Learn about the species of birds that are chirping in the morning. Go out to bars and just meet random people. When you buy a t-shirt, ask yourself -- &quot;what is this made out of; where was it produced?&quot; Buy local if you can; participate in local politics. Find out who your governor is, follow them on Twitter, and watch their press conferences. Connect with and support local artists. Do research on who the top 20 richest people in your city are, figure out what companies they own, and reach out if you have skills or resources to offer.</p>
        <p>[Small sidenote: There is a pre-step here, which is picking a local environment to live in that you actually like. I moved back home from San Francisco to Kansas City for this purpose; everything here is richer and higher fidelity at the smaller scales I can wrap my mind around. Living in a big shiny blob where everyone is richer and more connected than you makes it really hard to appreciate which details are important and which details are noise. The converse is also true; if you&#39;re bored in a tiny town somewhere, consider moving to a small city; but this is up to you and your current circumstances]</p>
        <p>It&#39;s almost not even important whether this &quot;strategy&quot; is &quot;effective&quot; for &quot;combating&quot; the simultaneous crises we&#39;re facing. It pretty much bleeds directly into the most ancient philosophical question of <em>how to live a good life</em>. And living a good life is probably the truest guide to whether you have the capability to be effective in larger arenas.</p>
        <p>To give an example; since I&#39;m writing from a Kansas City perspective, I&#39;ve lately taken an interest in the biography of Tom Pendergast. His story is one worth reading and considering; starting off working at his brother&#39;s tavern, he worked his way up through various companies and social groups. Eventually, he found himself in a position to run a largely  successful political machine for nearly a decade, becoming a key figure in the election of Harry Truman. His legacy was rather mixed; he was horribly corrupt, participated in organized crime, had a gambling problem. But his patterns of living life and political action is something that concerned young people should take to heart if they wish to improve their communities, their region, their nation, or the world.</p>
        <p>(Short-ish read here: <a href="https://pendergastkc.org/article/biography/pendergast-thomas-joseph">https://pendergastkc.org/article/biography/pendergast-thomas-joseph</a>)</p>
        <p>==</p>
        <p>So we&#39;re nearly finished. This is the longest thing I&#39;ve ever written; I&#39;m a little exhausted, and you might be too. (It&#39;s only 7000 words! I&#39;m still a little baby). I&#39;ll leave you with two final things.</p>
        <p>The first is that, I think writing is good. I think producing creative works of any kind of good, but I&#39;m biased toward writing, because it&#39;s the only thing I&#39;m half-decent at (I hope). If you have any writing skill, I think it would be good to try your hand at it. <em>get good at writing</em> was probably the single best piece of advice I&#39;ve gotten from a former mentor, and it&#39;s done wonders for me. If you decide to publish, though, be sure to know why it is you&#39;re doing it and what you hope to get out of it (see <a href="#writing">last post</a>).</p>
        <p>The last thing is that, well, I still have a bit of meanness left in me. If I didn&#39;t lose you with the Bernie Sanders bit, I want to press on the gas a little more. This advice will help you with everything listed above, and it&#39;s a lesson I&#39;ve learned from another mentor that has also done wonders for my life, but it is a bit harsh.</p>
        <p>It&#39;s summarized in a good saying sent to me recently, originally written by Wittgenstein. It is this:</p>
        <p>Wovon man nicht sprechen kann, darüber muß man schweigen.</p>
        <p>In simple terms, it means: Shut the fuck up.</p>
        <p>In your private life, between your friends, family, and therapists, you should express as many of your thoughts and feelings as you can. In a public forum, when you feel like saying or posting something, my honest advice is: <em>Shut the fuck up</em>.</p>
        <p>If you have strong opinions about what&#39;s going on in the world, or you have intense feelings you feel the need to share publicly; <em>shut the fuck up</em>.</p>
        <p>If you&#39;re trying to build rapport with somebody, and they have something on their mind, or they&#39;re trying to vent, you should <em>listen</em> and you should <em>shut the fuck up</em>.</p>
        <p>If you&#39;re meeting a new person, and trying to figure out who they are and whether they&#39;re worth having a relationship with, <em>shut the fuck up.</em></p>
        <p>If somebody you respect and trust is trying teach you something important, <em>shut the fuck up</em>.</p>
        <p>If something about this essay pisses you off you want to give me angry feedback about it: Definitely <em>shut the fuck up</em></p>
        <p>If you want to have a good life, good relationships, and contribute positively to the world, it would behoove you to learn and practice the art of <em>shutting the fuck up</em></p>
        <p>If you do have something worthwhile to say; if you&#39;ve thought about it carefully, considered it from many angles, and deliberated on it for a decent amount of time; if you can distinguish the emotions behind it, and deliver it calmly where possible, and passionately where necessary; if you can minimize your bias and ego while forming it; if you&#39;re aware of the possible benefits and consequences of saying it; if it is true, necessary, and as kind as possible: Then you can speak.</p>

        <p><strong>Tues Jun 16</strong></p>
        <p><em>Black lives matter.</em></p>
        <p>A week ago, I attended a protest in support of the BLM movement that had a neat idea; to distinguish between peaceful protestors and bad-faith agitators, everyone wore a white shirt with names written on them; citizens whose lives have been stolen due to police brutality and rampant civil racism. If someone was causing trouble without a white shirt, they&#39;d be easily identifiable. It was a silent march, and everyone walked in a single-file line across downtown Kansas City to hold vigil for George Floyd and the many others we have lost to the senseless evil of our criminal justice system, mirroring the &quot;Silent Parade&quot; held by the NAACP in 1917 New York City.</p>
        <p>These are the names I wrote:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Emmett Till (1955, Mississippi)</p>
        <p>At the age of 14 years old, Emmett Till flirted with a white girl named Carolyn Bryant. At 3am on August 28, 1955, two white men marched him out of his house into their truck and tied him up, despite his great aunt offering them money to leave. They drove him out to a barn, pistol whipped him until he was unconscious, shot him in the head, weighed him with a 70 pound fan, and dumped him in the river. His body was recovered three days later, marred beyond recognition; only identifiable by a silver ring he wore with the initials &quot;L.T.&quot;</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>Tamir Rice (2014, Cleveland)</p>
        <p>Tamir Rice was a 12-year-old boy playing with an airsoft gun at Cudell park. On November 22, 2014, two police officers drove up and shot him dead on sight. Video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw0EMLM1XRI">here</a>.</p>

        <li><p>John Africa (1985, Philadelphia)</p>
        <p>John Africa (born Vincent Leapheart) founded a back-to-nature movement called MOVE in 1972 West Philadelphia. A former army conscript during the Korean War, he developed a community ideology emphasizing religion, justice, individuality, and animal rights, among other things. As the movement grew, several neighbors issued various complaints, including a claim that MOVE organized armed patrols of their neighborhood, which preceded several conflicts with the police. After a shootout in 1978, when one police officer was killed, nine members were arrested for third degree murder. MOVE relocated to a new headquarters. In 1985, during another standoff with the police, Philadelphia mayor Frank Rizzo authorized the dropping of a firebomb (Tovex, a water-gel explosive), igniting a fire which eventually destroyed a rough total of sixty-five houses in the neighboring city block. This extraordinary story is documented in the 2013 film <a href="https://zeitgeistfilms.com/film/letthefireburn"><em>Let the Fire Burn</em></a>.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>Mahatma Gandhi (1948, New Delhi)</p>
        <p>Mahatma Gandhi organized the largest successful non-violent revolution against colonial British rule. He was killed on January 30 of 1948 by a Hindu nationalist. I don&#39;t need to belabor the story here. [Note: Gandhi was Hindu and a citizen of India]</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>James Powell (1964, Manhattan)</p>
        <p>An altercation developed between a local superintendent and three black boys. James Powell, age 15, arrived later, and allegedly pursued the superintendent into a building. After leaving almost immediately, he was shot three times by off-duty officer Lieutenant Gilligan, after raising his arms up in defense. Gilligan later claimed the boy was in possession of a knife. This incident sparked six consecutive nights of riots and protests in Harlem and surrounding neighborhoods, leading to vandalism and several protestors being beaten by NYPD officers. 118 protesters were injured, and one died.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>Botham Jean (2018, Dallas)</p>
        <p>An off-duty police officer came home, entered the wrong apartment, saw a black man, and killed him, believing he was a burglar. Initially charged with manslaughter, protests ensued, and she was later charged with murder. On the day of Jean&#39;s funeral, Dallas police released a search warrant showing that he had possessed 10.4 grams of marijuana.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>John Smith (1967, Newark)</p>
        <p>On the evening of July 12, 1967, a taxi driver was pulled over by the police for &quot;following another vehicle too closely&quot;. An altercation followed, and Smith was beaten badly, arrested, and dragged to the nearest precinct. Rumors spread that Smith had died in police custody, and a citywide riot broke out that lasted five days. At the end, 26 people had died and hundreds more were injured. You can read the police report <a href="http://riseupnewark.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/NPD-Chronological-Summary-of-Newark-Riots-Excerpt-on-John-Smith-ilovepdf-compressed.pdf">here</a>; I couldn&#39;t find any published eyewitness accounts.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>Eric Garner (2014, Staten Island)</p>
        <p>Eric Garner was selling loose cigarettes outside a store when he was approached by a plainclothes police officer. After pleading with the officer to leave him alone, he was placed under arrest; when he pulled his arms away from the handcuffs, saying &quot;don&#39;t touch me, please&quot;, the officer placed him in a chokehold, and within minutes he had died of suffocation. He was recorded saying &quot;I can&#39;t breathe&quot; eleven times before he went silent. The officer who killed him was not indicted, but was eventually fired -- five years after the incident.

        </li>
        <li><p>Daniel Shaver (2016, Arizona)</p>
        <p>Daniel Shaver was shot in the hallway of his own home after brandishing a pellet gun in his window. He had been having drinks with his friends when a rookie police officer showed up to investigate. As the officer attempted to apprehend Shaver in the hallway, he shouted a series of bizarre and confusing commands to have Shaver crawl forward to be arrested. Shaver attempted to comply, but instinctively reached behind himself, likely to either pull up his pants or scratch his lower back. The officer opened fire, striking Shaver five times and killing him almost instantly. The officer was fired and charged with second degree murder, but was acquitted. The officer was later reinstated into the force, but retired after only a month due to post-traumatic stress disorder from the incident.

        </li>
        <li><p>Robert Hall (1943, Georgia)</p>
        <p>A landmark Supreme Court decision, <em>Screws v. United States</em>,was handed down on May 7, 1945, regarding a brutal police killing of an unarmed black man named Robert Hall, two years earlier. A review published by Robert K Carr describes the incident as follows:</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px;"><em>Claud Screws was the sheriff of Baker County, reputedly one of the most backward counties in the state of Georgia. Aided by the defendant Jones, a policeman in the town of Newton in Baker County, and the defendant Kelley, a deputy sheriff, he arrested Robert Hall, a negro citizen of the United States, late on the night of January 29, 1943, on a warrant charging theft of a tire. Hall was handcuffed and taken by car to the court house. There, as he left the car, he was beaten by the three men with their fists and a two-pound blackjack. The defendants claimed that Hall used insulting language and, although he was still handcuffed, that he reached for a gun. Thereafter he was knocked to the ground and beaten for from fifteen to thirty minutes until he was unconscious. Hall was then dragged feet first through the court house yard into the jail and thrown upon the floor dying. An ambulance was called&quot; and he was taken to a hospital where he died within an hour without regaining consciousness. There was evidence that Screws and Hall had had a previous altercation over the possession of a gun by Hall, as the result of which Screws nursed a grudge against Hall and had threatened to &quot;get&quot; him.</em></p>
        <p> It took the court nearly seven months to render a decision, which ultimately reduced the federal government&#39;s authority to prosecute state and local officials for violating the due process clause of the 14th amendment. According to legal historian Christopher Waldrep, this case severely limited federal civil rights prosecutions for years. Carr&#39;s review is a fascinating look into the case and surrounding legal precedent; you can read it <a href="https://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi">here</a>.</p>
        </li>
        </ul>
        <p>==</p>
        <p> Two other observations stuck with me from the protest. As the march concluded, the group kneeled in silence for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, while an organizer read off a long list of names of black men and women who had been killed unjustly. About halfway through, a (black) man, not participating in the protest, began playing music loudly. There was some discomfort, but the reading carried on, until the man started shouting at the crowd: &quot;Fuck you! Fuck you all! You&#39;re all white!&quot;, among other things. Discomfort intensified, and people began nervously looking around, not sure what to do. Two local security officers (I don&#39;t think they were police) approached him and asked him to calm down, which only increased his shouting. Eventually, organizers from the protest came over, talked him down, and the man left.</p>
        <p> The only other thing I noticed, in a crowd of white shirts and solemn faces, was a young man wearing bright orange construction gear and a Guy Fawkes mask. No idea what that was about.</p>

      <div id="writing" style="padding-top: 15px">
        <p><strong>Sun Jun 7</strong></p>
        <p>As far as I can tell, there are three major reasons to write.</p>
        <ol>
        <li>To help people</li>
        <li>To get things you want without having to do patient hard work</li>
        <li>Because you&#39;re a lonely egotistical maniac who just can&#39;t shut up</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Let&#39;s go in order I guess. Writing actually doesn&#39;t help people that much. The primary benefits of good writing seem to be 1) distracting or entertaining people for a while, or 2) priming their subconscious with &quot;good&quot; ideas that have a small chance of floating into their mind later to influence them in a positive way.</p>
        <p>Of these, the entertainment value seems like the clearest net positive. There&#39;s nothing wrong with good entertainment, besides being distracting if the reader is trying to procrastinate on something important. With all this cognitive surplus we have in the modern age, and distressingly few outlets to channel it into something productive, I have to say that I&#39;m pro entertainment. We honestly don&#39;t have enough good entertainment, which leads people to derive &quot;entertainment&quot; from things which actually should be important and thoughtful (like politics).</p>
        <p>Benefit 2 is extremely tricky. In general, there are a great many positives from having and sharing good ideas. But actually executing this on purpose is basically impossible for humans. For starters, your ideas might not actually be good; they could be bad ideas. Even if you&#39;re expressing good things, they could come at the wrong time. Your intentions could be noble, but the reader might be pissed off at some subtle political connotation in your writing, so they associate your &quot;good&quot; thought as being a &quot;bad&quot; thought; propaganda from the enemy team (this happened for me with a lot of Social Justice content in my early 20s).</p>
        <p>Most of all, it&#39;s just not your place. Writing can have an incredibly strong influence on people, especially young minds. Writing necessarily violates the first principle of the Hippocratic oath; that of doing no harm. There is no surgical way to influence people positively through writing. (Silly example from my life; I was obsessed with Paul Graham in college, while I was studying computer science. Paul Graham is great. But he influenced me so much that I got pissed off with everyone around me, dropped out of college, and moved to San Francisco, where I spent a lot of time in misery and never even came close to founding a startup. Smh.)</p>
        <p>In short, writing can be <em>good</em>, but it cannot be <em>perfect</em>. &quot;Every good and perfect gift comes from above, from the Father of lights, in whom is no change nor shadow of turning&quot; - James 1:17.</p>
        <p>There is a third type of benefit people seem to get from writing, which is the whole genre of books and media that try to tell you directly what to think and how to behave. I never got much value from this stuff and I don&#39;t really understand it, but it seems to be popular -- in my estimation about 95% of books and essays seem to have a kind of &quot;do as I say and then things will be good for you&quot; flavor to it; 7 Habits Of Highly Effective Teens, 12 Rules For Life, etc. C&#39;est la vie; if people enjoy it, good for them. I personally choose to avoid this stuff where possible.</p>
        <p>===</p>
        <p>Why else do people write? To get things they want without having to do hard work.</p>
        <p>A lot of romantics learn to play guitar or write poetry to help them get laid. Businesspeople publish books on business so they can demonstrate to other business business-ers how business-y they are about business. Politicians and activists publish manifestos so they get votes and support. (You can actually tell a lot about what a person/party stands for just by reading them; I liked Andrew Yang when he was on the Joe Rogan podcast, but it wasn&#39;t until I read The War on Normal People that I was like &quot;holy crap this guy is serious&quot;).</p>
        <p>Art in general works because it is a display of talent, of understanding, of having a grasp on things, and (usually) a signal of the discipline and free energy it requires to learn, practice, and hone a challenging skill. Finally, it demonstrates the commitment to publish a beautiful, polished artifact.</p>
        <p>Writing is different from other artistic skills because, while it does require talent, it doesn&#39;t actually require too much discipline to churn out something that resonates with people strongly. It does require a lot of reading and writing, but it still doesn&#39;t need the sort of rote boring practice as, say, learning to play piano, or painting on canvas. You can just read a lot willy-nilly and poop out dumb thoughts to a journal over a couple of years and become decent enough at it to get a bunch of likes on the social medias.</p>
        <p>It kind of feels like a cheat code, to be honest. Good writing hijacks your attention and draws you in in ways that are, frankly, a bit rude. Humans are just highly susceptible to words and language in general -- most don&#39;t realize how little information is actually encoded in messages, and when you compress a lot of &quot;good&quot; ideas into a short space, it can potentially have a sort of hypnotic effect. If done with ill intent, the results can be disastrous (or even with good intent; see above).</p>
        <p>It&#39;s these properties of writing as an art form; strong effect, little discipline needed; that breed into you over time a very thick layer of skepticism toward people that are suspiciously good at words. Older people understand this better than I do; it&#39;s deeds, not words, that warrant trust and admiration from people who want something from you, or that you want to build some kind of relationship with.</p>
        <p>The best way you can get &quot;what you want&quot; out of reading and writing is just by getting a sense for who someone is. Personal accounts are infinitely better than abstract ideas in this regard. But even then, unless someone is extremely prolific and has written a lot, you still can&#39;t fully trust the slice of experience they&#39;re deciding to share with you. Prolificness is a really key indicator though; I&#39;ve met never met him, but I strongly assume that Stephen King is a generally good guy -- if only because he&#39;s clearly too busy writing all those damn books to get up to no good elsewhere in his life.</p>
        <p>===</p>
        <p>Finally, people write because they&#39;re a &quot;lonely egotistical maniac who can&#39;t shut up&quot;. Okay, I&#39;m being a little harsh here.</p>
        <p>I say &quot;lonely&quot; because, well, it&#39;s usually not worthwhile to produce good art if you&#39;re healthily engaged in performing duties and maintaining relationships that you&#39;re supposed to be doing. If you&#39;re not writing because you want something specific, or out of a misguided sense of helping people, you&#39;re doing it because you just <em>have</em> thoughts and you <em>need</em> to express them, dammit; you feel <em>compelled</em> to, even when you suspect it might be a bad idea.</p>
        <p>It can be because there are few people who understand you enough to feel like you&#39;re fully expressing yourself in the web of relationships that keep you sane, grounded, and human. It can be because you&#39;ve had a lot of &quot;interesting experiences&quot; (see <a href="#philosophy">last post</a>) that you still need to wrestle with. (Therapy is probably better than writing for this purpose, but finding a good therapist is basically &quot;as NP-hard&quot; as connecting to other lonely people through the written word). Flatly, I think Soren Kierkegaard puts it best:</p>
        <p>&quot;What is a poet? An unhappy person who conceals profound anguish in his heart, but whose lips are so formed that as sighs and cries pass over them they sound like beautiful music...</p>
        <p>And the people crowd around the poet and say to him: &quot;Sing again soon!&quot; -- in other words, may new sufferings torture your soul, and may your lips continue to be formed as before, because your screams would only alarm us, but the music is charming.&quot;</p>
        <p>Secondly, &quot;egotistical&quot;. I actually have no idea what an ego is. Everyone has too much of an ego, but also they have too little. Is ego your whole self, or just a part of yourself? I honestly have no clue, and I don&#39;t care; not my area of expertise, and also it&#39;s probably a stupid question. (For what it&#39;s worth, the best definition of ego I&#39;ve heard is from my dad; ego just means &quot;edge God out&quot;).</p>
        <p>I think what most people mean when they say someone is &quot;egotistical&quot; is just that they&#39;re not being humble. Being humble is super hard; I&#39;m not very good at it, but try to practice it every day. I don&#39;t really have any advice for being humble, other than constantly acknowledging that you&#39;re actually just not very cool, you&#39;re not very smart, and you&#39;re about as powerful as a cute little snapping turtle in the grand scheme of things.</p>
        <p>I say &quot;maniacal&quot; because writing is actually just a little mentally challenging. It actually does require grit, courage, and deep spiritual soundness. Writing about personal things that are important to you makes you <em>vulnerable</em>. If you record what&#39;s happening in your head onto a paper or a screen, you&#39;re giving everybody else a window into your soul. In general, this is a very bad idea! Maybe you need to have exactly one screw loose to pull it off correctly, reaping the benefits while minimize harm (to yourself and others). It can be very slightly scary sometimes, which is why most writers who do it a lot don&#39;t write about very personal stuff, or do it only rarely.</p>
        <p>This gets glorified way too often, IMO; I am extremely for having all of your screws completely tightened at all times, and getting too personal too often is just flatly a little ugly. If producing good art requires you to be a little crazy, choose sanity every time. I will say this; in the best version of producing excellent art of any kind, you do it to honor God.</p>
        <p>===</p>
        <p>Anyway, those are some of my thoughts on writing. Thank you for reading. And sorry if I hijacked your attention; as stated, it is rude and I apologize.</p>
        <p>If you&#39;re curious, here&#39;s a short list of writers who have influenced me deeply over the course of my life:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Paul Graham</li>
        <li>Michael Crichton</li>
        <li>Venkatesh Rao</li>
        <li>Soren Kierkegaard</li>
        <li>David Wong</li>
        <li>Scott Alexander</li>
        <li>George R.R. Martin</li>
        <li>Sarah Perry</li>
        <li>Stephen King</li>
        <li>Joel Spolsky</li>
        <li>[this space left intentionally blank; another highly influential blogger]</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To most of them, I express the deepest gratitude. To others, I say &quot;fuck you&quot;. Still not really sure which is which.</p>

      <div id="philosophy" style="padding-top: 15px">
        <p><strong>Mon May 25</strong></p>
        <p>To live a good life -- to have deep satisfaction, to help others, and to exercise your will while minimizing external harm -- you must do one of two things. You either adjust to the small town you grew up in, or you have interesting experiences (and survive them).</p>
        <p>I think most people who have lived interesting lives would agree that the first path is preferable; listen to your parents, do good in school, have good health, cherish those around you, pay attention to the small things. There&#39;s an old Chinese saying -- &quot;<em>may you live in interesting times&quot;</em> -- that is actually intended as a curse on your enemies. (Apparently, this is apocryphal; whatever).</p>
        <p>The consolation prize of doing interesting things is that hardship does, indeed, breed character. You grow stronger. You grow more flexible. If you&#39;re lucky, your heart does not become dimmer; in fact it can become as bright as ever. The only thing you wasted is time, which you can never recover.</p>
        <p>If you couldn&#39;t fit into the small town you grew up and just <em>had</em> to see the world, make mistakes, and &#39;learn things the hard way&#39;, one thing you might notice is that each new experience or hardship starts to bring you less and less growth. It becomes extremely expensive (in terms of time wasted and risk incurred) to learn each new lesson. For me, it took about 1.5 years to learn my last big lesson (Lord willing). I won&#39;t get into the details, but the upshot is that my health deteriorated, many relationships were put on pause, my financial trajectory was waylaid, and it generally sucked huge hard monkey balls.</p>
        <p>I didn&#39;t even learn anything specific; just another stupid lesson in humility, and a putting together of things I&#39;ve already learned in a way that makes sense for my life. Things became clearer for a while, and then they became muddied, and then clearer again, and then finally to a state I like to call <em>comfortably muddied.</em> Looking back on the myriad mistakes I made in my 20s, and having survived them almost entirely due to sheer luck, I must say that I am glad I made them, and would be very glad to avoid making major mistakes in the future.</p>
        <p>Life is indeed much more enjoyable after growing as much as you need to. Yesterday I talked to a guy who took a gig just watching a bonfire for 7 hours. How did he do that? I would get so bored. (He also told me he took another gig killing coyotes, at $50 per coyote, which sounds like something out of an old West movie). Another guy traveled around the country, rigging up fiber cables for presidential speeches. He currently works on retrofitting alternative fuel vehicles that run on compressed natural gas. I learned later that his father collected player pianos (pianos that play themselves, or something; to be honest, I was a little distracted by the pretty girl at our table, who wasn&#39;t interested in talking; I probably seem too intense).</p>
        <p>Overall, life is good. There&#39;s a lot of boring stuff I&#39;d like to take care of (health, relationships, money, networking, finding the perfect apartment), but I guess I&#39;m comfortable doing the whole <em>writer / philosopher / observer</em> cliche every once in a while.</p>
        <p>Okay, hell, a couple lessons I guess.</p>
        <p>One is that being a millennial digital-native-computer-addict is a uniquely hard generational challenge that most old people don&#39;t understand. You&#39;re used to things going super fast. if you want to get a piece of information, cycle through 1,000 people hotter than you on instagram, or read the hottest deep state conspiracies, it&#39;s all available to you. But the old people are fundamentally right; <em>you&#39;ve got to slow the hell down</em>. Prayer and meditation work wonders. Listen to birds, learn <a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Do-Nothing-Resisting-Attention/dp/1612197493">how to do nothing</a>. But also remember to keep yourself busy, and that time is a precious resource. Patience is a virtue, and it is both harder and more intellectually challenging than it may appear.</p>
        <p>The second virtue that I know about is kindness. All hats off to Vonnegut; <em> <strong>god dammit, you&#39;ve got to be kind</strong> </em>. Many people have been tremendously kind to me over the course of my life, and I would like to pay that back by being kind to others. Kindness really makes the world go &#39;round, and it&#39;s more important than ever if you are cursed with living in interesting times.</p>
        <p>Kindness and patience are virtues because they&#39;re things that you must do, even if you don&#39;t want to do them.</p>
        <p class="mb200">Have a good memorial day.</p>
        <p>(this is a player piano, by the way)</p>
